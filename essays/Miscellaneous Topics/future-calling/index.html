<p>When I was a twenty-something, just entering the computer world of the early 1970’s, computer languages to watch were Fortran, PL/1, COBOL, Lisp, Algol, APL, Pascal – and a hundred types of assembly language.</p>
<p>Even back then, one language was especially reviled for its ugly syntax – or rather the fact that no one could program with it without using special pads of coding paper. This was a language developed by IBM in 1959 called Report Program Generator (RPG). RPG was really only good for one thing – generating boxes and boxes of “greenbar” – thirty pound stacks of computer printouts. Even in 1971 the preferred business language was COBOL.</p>
<p>Fast forward a mere thirty years to 2000. RPG programmers were already recognized as an endangered species – endangered by evolution. One <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcpressonline.com/programming/rpg/rpgthe-walking-dead">article provocatively</a> (“RPG – the Walking Dead?”) asked: “Is RPG dead?”</p>
<p>So there you had it – a generation ago, on the cusp of a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K apocalypse</a> (that never happened) – a forward-looking author counseling fellow programmers to abandon relics like RPG, learn computer languages of the next millennium – and be prepared for the wave after <em>that</em> – Object Oriented Programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you’re ready to retire, you should stop by your favorite bookstore, pick up a copy of UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modelling Language or a similar book, and start learning the ubiquitous language of OO designs. Also download the Whiteboard edition of Together/J (www.togethersoft. com) and start familiarizing yourself with an OO design and analysis tool. Besides helping you learn OO concepts, Together/J will help you learn Java by reviewing the source code it generates. With this knowledge, you should be in a better position to learn the next OOP language in vogue with minimal effort. <strong>The clock is ticking. Where will you be when it strikes midnight?</strong> Hopefully, not with the walking dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The clock certainly was ticking, as it always is. Coal miners received similar advice a century ago – as New Bedford sperm oil whalers did a century before <em>that</em> – after prospectors found petroleum in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>But after millions of years of human existence, is anyone really surprised that change is practically the only constant?</p>
<p>Besides the president?</p>
<p>This is a guy who’s made political pets of coal miners. Instead of actually helping them by rolling out alternative energy infrastructure projects and training miners for jobs with a future, Trump and his Republican Congress will simply give them <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/523980/">federal pensions</a> and hope they go quietly into the night. But as Alana Semuels writes in the <em>Atlantic</em> – why stop there?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it bails out the miners, why stop there? Why not bail out all of the other pension funds, private and public, that are on the brink of insolvency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why stop there, indeed. The Trump administration could also create special programs to save the nation’s remaining 283 RPG programmers.</p>
<p>Like the miners (and the coal owners) who were warned a century ago that petroleum was coming, the poor pioneering RPG programmers were so hard at work on their coding pads – keeping American business humming – that they never heard the future calling.</p>
