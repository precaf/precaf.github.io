There are many things a global pandemic ought to make us see with new eyes — what social animals we really are, for one. Now is a good time  for us all to insist that we actually live in a society, not just an  economy. I’ve heard from and communicated with my friends and neighbors  more these last two weeks than at any other time. When these connections are limited, we feel deeply what we take for granted.

Another is the value of our fellow citizens. In a world where the  working class doesn’t get enough respect, maybe now we should recognize  there is a whole army of “essential workers” keeping the lights on, the  stores open, and infrastructure going. It’s not just first responders  and medical caregivers who are the real heroes. We all are. We are all  indispensable pieces of a whole.

And maybe, too, we ought to reconsider the purpose of government. Our society is not mere scaffolding for Business and Capital, with  government there mainly to collect taxes, enforce property rights, and  police city streets. There is an essential role for government to play  in keeping citizens safe, healthy, and economically secure.

As companies shed workers and lobby [again] for massive economic  bailouts, it should be obvious that the market economy is not a machine  designed to look out for anyone’s interests but its own. Conversations  about the social safety net, basic income, and a government that defends its people in ways besides building walls and bombs must reshape what  kind of society we will live in and the quality of lives its citizens  can lead.

That is, once the world has been rebooted.

It’s increasingly clear that we also need to take the risks to human  life of environmental change and pandemics much more seriously.  Deferring action on climate change for 10-20 more years will lead to the same sort of crisis that deferring action on pandemics has created.  Google the [2006 TED Talk on global pandemics](https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_my_wish_help_me_stop_pandemics) by Epidemiologist Dr. Larry Brilliant.

About thirteen minutes into the video Brilliant predicts with uncanny accuracy the pandemic we are experiencing today. And he asks for the  world to take action to prevent it from happening. But that TED talk was 14 years ago, and today we can see the result of complacency, denial  and inaction.

It may be too much to ask — from a nation that voted for “America  First” and which does not believe it is truly a part of a world  community, doesn’t fully recognize the UN or the legitimacy of  international courts, only briefly joined international environmental  accords, and which rejects basic science — that we must participate, if  not take a leading role, in an international health plan such as the one Dr. Brilliant suggests. But it would be the smart and right and sane  thing to do.

We will soon see if the world is capable of saving itself through  solidarity, justice and rationality. Unfortunately, centuries of human  history present a strong case against it. But what other choice do we  have?
