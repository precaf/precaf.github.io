Welcome to the Trump presidency.

In most democracies, leaders are elected by popular vote, not some crazy slave era concoction like the [Electoral College](http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/11/22/why-was-the-electoral-college-created-slavery-orig.cnn). And in most parliamentary democracies citizens don't have to suffer incompetence and corruption without relief. In most democracies there is a provision to hold new elections on a [vote of no-confidence](http://www.britannica.com/topic/vote-of-confidence). But in the United States we either wait four years to throw the bum out -- or we can try to impeach him. There is already a [campaign underway](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/20/the-campaign-to-impeach-president-trump-has-begun/) to get rid of a president who started his term in violation of the [Emoluments Clause](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section9) of the Constitution:

> "... no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state."

Although conservatives wave away the word "emolument" as vague, it appears in Samuel Johnson's [1775 dictionary](http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/?page_id=7070&i=690), and still means today what it meant back then: *profit; advantage*. Constitutional lawyers, including Fordham Law Professor [Zephyr Teachout](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/11/17/would-trumps-foreign-business-ties-be-constitutional/trumps-foreign-business-ties-may-violate-the-constitution) and others from the [Brookings Institution](http://www.brookings.edu/research/the-emoluments-clause-its-text-meaning-and-application-to-donald-j-trump/), argue that Trump cannot continue *profiting* from his international "deals," especially when he is the only president in American history to [refuse to divest](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-finance-idUSKBN14V21I) himself of conflicts-of-interest.

The Trump cabinet, while not yet rubber-stamped by the Republican Congress, is shaping up to be a weird assortment of billionaires, generals, scammers, ideologues, and incompetents. God help us when Rick Perry assumes control of the Dept. of Energy's nukes. Or when Ben Carson puts up the photo of himself and Jesus in his new HUD office. Before settling down to a nap. Or when Betsy deVos becomes the homeschooling czarina. Or when Jeff Sessions dismantles programs to reign in police violence against black lives.

You think *Ferguson* was bad...

While Bill Clinton was actually impeached for consentual sex with a White House intern, Republicans seem less inclined to hold Trump to the same standard -- or any standard at all. Trump's [ex-wife's divorce deposition](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/24/documenting-trumps-abuse-of-women) included charges that he raped her and there is a very [long list](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/all-the-women-accusing-trump-of-rape-sexual-assault.html) of [victims](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/24/documenting-trumps-abuse-of-women) of his sexual abuse, including [Summer Zervos](http://fortune.com/2017/01/18/donald-trump-defamation-sexual-assault-denial/), who is suing Trump for defamation. This particular case could bring evidence, including videos, to light.

A serial misogynist and abuser and his incompetent cabinet.

Thus, it was appropriate that [millions of women marched](http://twitter.com/hashtag/WomensMarch) in *hundreds* of American cities. [By one count](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xa0iLqYKz8x9Yc_rfhtmSOJQ2EGgeUVjvV4A8LsIaxY/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0) as many as 4.6 million women in 600 cities protested the crotch-grabber-in-chief:

Pictures of the march were truly impressive. Washington DC was awash in pink. If you click on [this link](http://twitter.com/VanJones68/status/823163575355244546) you can see the crowd from a drone-eye view:

People [from the SouthCoast](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20170121/southcoast-residents-join-in-historic-womens-marches) (MA) also took part in local rallies.

And even before Trump's inauguration, local demonstrators from the Coalition for Social Justice, the ACLU, and various unions and church groups were protesting Sheriff Thomas Hodgson's publicity-*stunted* proposal to use prisoners for slave labor to build Trump's Mexican wall.

\* \* \*

In today's local paper [Robert Xifaras](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/opinion/20170122/your-view-show-respect-to-office) wrote that, in his 87 years, he has never seen so many "'shameless deplorable unpatriotic divisive malcontents' who have entered into a conspiracy not only to attack the legitimacy of the election, but to further espouse \[...\] hatred." *Show some respect for the office!*

Mr. Xifaras has apparently only recently started following the news since he obviously missed the [Birtherism and racism](http://theawl.com/primate-in-chief-a-guide-to-racist-obama-monkey-photoshops-d31499c602e5#.h8wipm140) that Trump had a major hand in spreading.

Well, Republicans, have fun being in charge.

For now.
