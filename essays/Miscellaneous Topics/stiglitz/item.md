Joseph E. Stiglitz writes in his new book, and in [a recent article](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/05/joseph-stiglitz-the-price-on-inequality): the US is first in income inequality in the world, and it's getting even worse. Social mobility is greater even in "old Europe" than here. The six Wal-Mart heirs own as much as the bottom 30% of the entire United States! So much for the "American Dream." Kids, go to grad school abroad, then stay there.
