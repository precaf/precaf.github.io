What nation permits the secret police to spy on its regular citizens with little oversight, cultivates informants, infiltrates cultural and political organizations, and turns neighbor against neighbor?

If you immediately thought of East Germany and the Stasi &#8212; go to the back of the class! This is happening in your own country.

The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/us/13fbi.html "New York Times article") reports today that the [FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide](http://documents.nytimes.com/the-new-operations-manual-from-the-f-b-i "FBI Domestic Investigation manual") will be modified to make unconstitutional fishing expeditions easier for the FBI. The relaxed rules permit investigations:

*   without any evidence of wrongdoing or criminal activity
*   without recording their reasons for doing so
*   administering lie-detector tests more easily
*   permitting more aggressive dumpster-diving
*   relaxing use of repeated surveillance squads
*   making it easier to infiltrate activist organizations
*   reducing restrictions on use of informants
*   permitting informants to permit in religious services
