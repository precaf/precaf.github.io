<p>As Donald Trump fights the numerous criminal charges he earned while
running the Presidency into the ground, I am reminded of Trump’s
<em>second</em> impeachment trial in which he was exonerated by an all
white jury – well, actually, Republican Senators. Same principle,
though. Men who believe they are above the law.</p>
<p>The House’s Articles of Impeachment had <em>already</em> been
watered-down and consisted only of Trump’s most <em>recent</em> attempts
to extort Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 presidential election. Those
charges did not include <em>anything</em> from the Mueller report,
Trump’s numerous emoluments clause violations, lying about illegal
payments to porn stars or mistresses, or any of the many obstructions of
justice to come. Prosecution by the Senate should have been a slam dunk
but we all know what happened.</p>
<p>If all that winking and looking away at crime, and the kid-glove
treatment, was not bad enough, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell fast-tracked the Senate trial down to two weeks — three times
shorter than Nixon’s. For sake of comparison, in 2016, when South Korea
impeached president Park Geun-hye for corruption and influence-peddling,
prosecutors charged her with 13 counts remarkably similar to Trump’s,
and her trial in South Korea’s Constitutional Court lasted 10 weeks.
Gun-hye’s refusal to appear before the court was never an impediment to
her conviction.</p>
<p>But with Trump, well, kid gloves.</p>
<p>The travesty of justice Americans witnessed in the Senate that year
was reminiscent of special treatment numerous white criminals have
received in other sham trials:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1955, when Emmett Till was murdered and his body thrown into the
Tallahatchie River, his killers were acquitted by an all-white jury
after one <em>hour</em> of deliberation.</li>
<li>In 1963, after Medgar Evers was gunned down in Mississippi, two
all-white juries acquitted his killers in separate trials.</li>
<li>In 1998, when 13 white supremacists were charged with attempting to
murder a federal judge and FBI agent, they were acquitted by an
all-white jury.</li>
<li>In 2013, George Zimmerman was found not guilty of the murder of
Trayvon Martin by a jury with only one juror of color.</li>
<li>In 2016, a group of armed sovereign citizens who occupied the
Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were acquitted by an all-white jury —
while on the same day unarmed Native Americans protesting a pipeline on
their own land were maced and beaten by police.</li>
<li>It’s not even possible to list the thousands of times that white
police officers have murdered unarmed black men and been acquitted or
simply not charged.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday, after only a brief pause from its election denial
propaganda, FOX News was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/14/fox-news-labels-joe-biden-a-wannabe-dictator-during-trump-speech">back
at it</a>, calling Biden a “wannabe dictator” and portraying the
<em>real</em> wannabe dictator, Trump, as the victim of – well –
prosecution for crimes anybody else would be prosecuted for. To hear
just about every Republican tell it, not one of the standard rules of
justice applies to a white supremacist criminal like Trump. Apparently
only [non-white] “banana republics” prosecute their corrupt
politicians.</p>
<p>But let’s not forget the many other get-out-of-jail cards available
for white men. <em>Stand Your Ground</em> laws, statutes encouraging
vigilantism, and the doctrine of <em>Qualified immunity</em> — a magic
wand to wave away police murders. Add to this the increasing abuse of
presidential and gubernatorial pardons for MAGA criminals and
insurrectionists. Criminals who believe they’re above the law.</p>
<p>For the moment it’s not looking so good for Trump in 2024. If Biden
<em>does</em> win this election, I am troubled by the nagging concern
that Biden – in pursuing some sort of misguided <em>national unity</em>
objective – might end up pardoning Trump’s federal crimes, just as
Gerald Ford wiped the slate clean for Richard Nixon. This would be a
huge mistake.</p>
<p>Rubbing the average citizen’s nose in impunity for serious
criminality will do nothing to alter the perception that American
justice is a cruel joke. If the most corrupt man in America is not
subject to the same laws as the rest of us, we might as well open the
prison doors and let <em>all the criminals</em> walk free.</p>
