<p><em>Americans have a strange view of presidential
accountability</em></p>
<p>On August 8th, after a dozen FBI agents showed up <a
target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3593418-fbi-raids-trumps-mar-a-lago/">unannounced</a>
at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of ex-president Donald Trump,
MAGAworld began calling for civil war. “Tomorrow is war,” tweeted Steven
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/mar-lago-search-users-trump-forums-agitate-civil-war-jan-6-rioter-rcna42148">Crowder</a>,
a Trump supporter with 5 million YouTube and 2 million Twitter
followers. Another MAGA <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.salon.com/2022/08/09/cries-of-civil-war-reach-pitch-after-fbi-search-of-mar-a-lago/">Tweet</a>
invoked civil war directly: “The Feds are currently RAIDING Mar-A-Lago.
This could very well be the equivalent of the FIRST SHOT fired upon Fort
Sumter. I believe they want a civil war. What other outcome can this
bullsh!t lead to?”</p>
<p>For many Americans — including a lot of Democrats — it is
unimaginable that even a corrupt, criminal American president like Trump
could ever serve a day in jail. For starters, it has never happened. But
there is also the matter of presidential pardons which seem to have kept
Richard Nixon out of jail. Or maybe we simply regard presidents as
untouchable monarchs. While Trump was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/23/politics/donald-trump-shoot-somebody-support/index.html">campaigning</a>
in Iowa in 2016 he joked, “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and
shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters.” He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>In general White America views the punishment of criminal presidents
and prime ministers as something that only happens in unstable,
undemocratic — meaning <em>non-European</em> — parts of the world. After
the FBI’s raid on his father’s compound, Donald Trump Jr. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/08/08/3rd-world-banana-republic-donald-trump-jr-reacts-to-fbi-raid-on-mar-a-lago/">tweeted</a>:
“This is what you see happen in 3rd World Banana Republics” — a view
shared by Ron <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-desantis-trum-fbi-raid-mar-a-lago-20220809-wn4dzd6ao5el7bmn3es4nlvaca-story.html">DeSantis</a>.
Even former Democratic presidential hopeful <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/andrew-yang-s-criticism-fbi-s-search-trump-s-mar-n1297847">Andrew
Yang</a> went out of his way to attack the investigation of the corrupt
ex-president.</p>
<p>But America has never had any qualms about holding former leaders of
other nations to account. When deposed Lybian president Muammar Qaddafi
was captured, mutilated, and murdered, then-Secretary of State Hillary
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-on-qaddafi-we-came-we-saw-he-died/">Clinton</a>
joked, “We came, we saw, he died.” When Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was tried
by a US-approved regime and executed, President <a
target="_blank" href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061229-15.html">Bush</a>
wrote, “Saddam Hussein received a fair trial. This would not have been
possible without the Iraqi people’s determination to create a society
governed by the rule of law.” But when it comes to corrupt American
presidents, no such rules of law ever seem to apply.</p>
<p>In fact, the rules by which one foreign despot is a friend and
another an enemy seem to boil down to anti-communism and global
alliances — and not the rule of law. Joe Biden’s fist bump with Saudi
murderer/dictator Muhammad bin Salman while doubling down on sanctions
on Cuba’s rulers are a good contrast. America continues to praise
Brazilian and Indian democracies as the “largest democracies in the
world” (other than our own) — <em>despite</em> their authoritarian
character and <em>because</em> of their overt anti-communism.</p>
<p>Indira Gandhi was a corrupt prime minister whose family was Indian
royalty and was spared any jail time. The “scourge of communists” and
Naxalites, Gandhi issued a series of dictatorial decrees, imposed
censorship, suspension of civil liberties, and arrested political
opponents (including current PM Modi), which eventually led to her
assassination by her own security detail. In fact, long before Modi,
Indira Gandhi’s rule marked the beginning of the end of Indian democracy
— precisely because she was never held to account.</p>
<p>Upon coming to power, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, a Republican darling,
vowed to purge Brazil of political opponents. “These red outlaws will be
banished from our homeland. It will be a cleanup the likes of which has
never been seen in Brazilian history.” Bolsonaro, of course, is the
product of the U.S. looking the other way at Brazil’s far right (and
anti-communist) military, which never really went away.</p>
<p>Hungary’s Viktor Orban, the GOP’s new idol and another virulent
anti-communist, grabbed power this year by declaring a state of
emergency and now rules by decree. Judging by his prominence at two
recent CPAC conferences, Orban’s Fidesz party is the new model for
American democracy.</p>
<p>So while we love anti-communist despots and refuse to prosecute our
own criminal leaders, other western-oriented nations have somehow
managed to hold their leaders to account.</p>
<p>Norway actually executed its Nazi collaborationist Prime Minister
Vidkun Quisling for high treason. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon
was convicted of fraud and misuse of funds. The French President Fillon
served under, Nicolas Sarkozy, was likewise jailed for corruption,
influence peddling, and bribery of a federal magistrate. Former Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert went to jail on corruption charges. Former
Israeli President Moshe Katsav served time in prison on rape charges.
And Israel’s best-known PM Benjamin Netanyahu is now facing prison on
multiple charges of corruption and bribery.</p>
<p>Canada’s Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Lise Thibault, served time in
prison for misuse of public funds. The Premier of Western Australia Ray
O’Connor was sent to prison on charges of fraud. Scottish First Minister
Alex Salmond was arrested on sexual harassment charges. Portuguese Prime
Minister Jose Socrates was sent to prison for corruption, tax evasion,
and money laundering. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov was
recently arrested on multiple corruption charges. British Virgin Islands
PM Alturo Fahie was arrested on drug smuggling charges. South Korean
Finance Minister Choi Kyoung-hwan served time in prison for an
influence-peddling scheme that also took down the South Korean president
Park Geun-hye. Puerto Rican Governor Wanda Vazquez was charged with
conspiracy, federal programs bribery and wire fraud by the DOJ.</p>
<p>Given the hesitancy to prosecute a popular leader with a large
following, Americans may end up following Italy’s lead. Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud and corruption
charges and sentenced to four years in prison, which due to his age he
never actually served. Berlusconi was <em>also</em> barred from public
office, a ban which only applied to Italy and did not affect his ability
to serve as a member of European Parliament. It was a resolution that
probably made no one happy.</p>
<p>But if Democrats really want to preserve democracy, Trump
<em>must</em> be prosecuted. What the nature of that punishment consists
of can vary, but if we simply close the books on Trump’s multiple
crimes, then we should also empty the jails and prisons because then the
rule of law will have absolutely no meaning.</p>
