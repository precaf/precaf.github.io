<p>Donald Trump did tremendous damage to the Supreme Court by appointing
two Christian Nationalist zealots during his single term. Trump, a
sexual predator in his own right, appointed accused sexual predator
Brett Kavanaugh to join accused sexual predator Clarence Thomas in a
court already swimming with misogyny.</p>
<p>In a nation where only 23% of all citizens regard themselves as
Catholic, 7 of 9 — 78% — of current Supreme Court justices are Catholic
(Kagan is Jewish, Jackson is Protestant). Several of the Catholic
justices reject the liberal Catholicism that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-sins-of-the-high-courts-supreme-catholics">came
out of</a> the Second Vatican Council, a papal nod to modernity,
equality, and justice. Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s last appointment,
actually belongs to a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/26/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-donald-trump-people-of-praise">Catholic
cult</a> replete with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/10/07/what-does-it-mean-that-amy-coney-barrett-served-as-a-handmaid-in-a-religious-group/?sh=74329e8a8932">handmaids</a>
(not precisely what you think). There is not a single gay justice on the
Court, although at least 7.2% of all Americans are gay. This is a court
that knows little and cares even less about the diverse lives of
ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>The Court’s recent, explosive rulings both snub their nose at
<em>stare decisis</em> and dishonestly select cases based on fraudulent
<em>standing</em> before the court. Where once it took a panel of legal
experts to discern the legal principles behind a decision, now it only
requires asking the question: what would Donald Trump want?</p>
<p>Worse, the Court is now encroaching upon the functions of the other
branches of government. In her dissent to the Court’s ruling on <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65931653">student debt
cancellation</a>, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that “the result here is
that the court substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch
in making national policy about student-loan forgiveness”.</p>
<p>“Congress authorised the forgiveness plan… the [education secretary]
put it in place; and the president would have been accountable for its
success or failure,” she wrote. “But this court today decides that some
40 million Americans will not receive the benefits of the plan (so says
the court) that assistance is too ‘significant’”.</p>
<p>Most dishonestly, the Court violated a basic legal principle of
<em>standing</em> (as it also did in the website case) by conjuring up
an aggrieved party with <a
target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/justice/2023-06-19-student-loan-cancellation-supreme-court-mohela/">no
standing</a> to actually bring its complaint before the Court. The Court
claimed the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA), a student
loan servicer that conducts day-to-day operations on federal student
loans, would lose revenue as a consequence of debt cancellation. The
only problem is that MOHELA did not bring the suit and said <a
target="_blank" href="https://protectborrowers.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22-506_Biden-v-NE_ArchCity-Defenders-and-LSEM_AMICI-CURIAE.pdf">in
its own financial documents</a> that it didn’t plan to make any payments
in the future.</p>
<p><img src="mohela.jpg" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, an <a
target="_blank" href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RI_Flawed-Claims-of-Legal-Standing-in-Biden-v-Nebraska_brief_202305.pdf">analysis</a>
from the Roosevelt Institute and the Debt Collective shows that MOHELA
stood to <em>gain</em> revenue if debt cancellation had gone forward. In
selecting this case and faking the plaintiff, the Court was not settling
a dispute; it was going out of its way to preempt both the Executive and
Legislative branches of government.</p>
<p>For the past year following the Dobbs decision, the Court has drawn
intense criticism, with critics eager to revisit the lies and ethical
violations of its black-robed sexual predators, as well as those who
took cash and gratuities from billionaires and then ruled on cases
affecting these sugar daddies.</p>
<p>But the last straw has been the Court’s outrageous violations of
judicial precedent and dishonesty in picking and choosing cases as well
as manufacturing aggrieved parties. We have finally reached the point
where many are calling for impeachment, reforms and court expansion.</p>
<p>The Constitution’s Article III, Section 1 says that federal judges
can hold their offices “during good behavior.” With a corrupt Supreme
Court, it’s sobering to consider that the Supreme Court itself may have
the last word in deciding if conspiring with your wife on an
insurrection, letting billionaires buy your decisions, or violating
basic legal principles that would disbar lesser judges constitutes
grounds for impeachment. One hopes it is entirely in Congress’s
hands.</p>
<p>Reforms can be accomplished by the Court itself, others only by
Congress, and others (term limits or court diversity) only by
Constitutional amendment. The reform group <a
target="_blank" href="https://fixthecourt.com/">Fix the Court</a> does not advocate the
expansion of the Court but does advocate: term limits, tighter ethics
and disclosure rules, public access to court proceedings, divestiture of
individual stocks by justices, more rigorous recusal rules,
comprehensive financial disclosures, and public disclosures of the many
media appearances most of us didn’t even know that justices make.</p>
<p>Expanding the court, however, does not require altering the
Constitution. It could theoretically be done today. This is a position
that an increasing number of legislators, including both Massachusetts
senators, advocate. The group <a
target="_blank" href="https://demandjustice.org/">Demand Justice</a> advocates for court
expansion. Democrats have already filed <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/democrats-introduce-bill-expand-supreme-court-9-13-justices-n1264132">legislation</a>
to expand the court, though it is unclear why they think it would
survive a Constitutional sniff test. Expansion is something the
President can do with Senate approval. The only problem is: the current
president <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/joe-biden-interviewed-msnbc-scotus-decision-rcna91871">refuses
to</a> expand the court.</p>
<p>But adding justices is hardly a new idea. Donald Trump’s next
favorite president (after himself, of course) was Andrew Jackson, who
added two justices to the Court in 1836. In 1937 the very
<em>threat</em> of expanding the Court to 15 justices by Franklin Delano
Roosevelt was enough to return several obstructionist justices to less
ideologically-motivated positions.</p>
<p>Which is not to say the court does not also need major reform. There
is nothing sacred about nine justices or lifetime presidential
appointments. The way justices are appointed in other Western nations
puts our poorly-defined scheme to shame.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada is appointed by the Governor in Council
and consists of nine justices. The number started out as six, was bumped
up to seven, and ultimately became nine. On the surface Canada’s looks
like ours, but Canada’s Supreme Court Act requires that three judges
come from Ontario, three from Quebec, two from the Western provinces or
Northern Canada and one from the Atlantic provinces. And judges must
also retire before their 75th birthdays.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has twelve justices (shown
above) and they must have already served on the bench for 15 years, or
two on a “federal” bench. The UK convenes a selection commission chosen
from judiciaries in Britain, Scotland, Northern Island and Wales, and it
strives for at least regional balance. After selection, a justice is
formally appointed by the Queen. Even with 12 justices that number can
still be increased. Justices must retire at 70 or 75, depending on when
they joined the bench.</p>
<p>The German Federal Constitutional Court
(<em>Bundesverfassungsgericht</em>, or BVerfG), has sixteen justices
divided a couple of ways into two senates and three chambers. Judges are
elected by both the <em>Bundestag</em> and the <em>Bundesrat</em>, each
of which selects eight justices. A Justice must have previously held a
position on the bench and be at least 40 years of age. Justices serve
for 12 years or until the age of 68, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The French Court of <em>Cassation</em> is the highest appeal court in
France and has an elaborate system of chambers and sitting and
administrative judges, but 15 justices head up the court. These 15
judges serve a 9 year term and 3 each are appointed by the President of
the Republic and Senate and National Assembly presidents. To become a
judge a lawyer must be admitted to the Supreme Court Bar after passing
an exam from the National School of the Magistracy. Typically,
candidates are already judges in lower courts.</p>
<p>Our Supreme Court selection process is a mess. Not only is it highly
politicized, but it lacks regional and demographic representation,
professionalism, and justices typically serve well past normal
retirement. More importantly, the selection process is simply
undemocratic. And timidity, inertia, and a vague Constitution seem to
prevent Congress from using its powers to rein in abuses by the Judicial
branch.</p>
<p>We need a serious re-do of the selection process as well as term
limits for the Supreme Court. And there are many places to look for good
ideas, starting with those of our closest allies. Add Supreme Court
reform to a long list of Constitutional changes necessary to
<em>update</em> American democracy rather than <em>overturn</em> it —
now that we’ve seen how fragile ours really is.</p>
<p>But in the interim, let’s expand the Supreme Court.</p>
