<p>In June 2022 the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson
Women’s Health Organization that women no longer have a Constitutional
right to abortion. While previously the personal privacy of women had
been balanced by the State’s interest in the life of a <em>viable</em>
fetus, a woman is now little more than a uterus without rights for the
majority-Catholic court. Once Dobbs was decided, an emboldened
Republican Party quickly announced it had other reproductive and civil
rights in its crosshairs.</p>
<p>While the Democratic Party in general is now pushing to strengthen
reproductive rights in Blue states, and claims it wants to make abortion
a winning 2024 campaign issue, President Joe Biden <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/biden-abortion-rights-dobbs-roe-v-wade">told</a>
a group of wealthy donors recently that, while he supported the Roe v
Wade compromise, “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion…”
This lack of urgency (or real commitment for that matter) coming from an
80 year-old male citing his religious reservations is guaranteed to take
the air out of the Democratic Party’s support for the bodily autonomy of
women.</p>
<p>Yesterday the majority white Supreme Court dismantled Affirmative
Action programs and upheld the rights of Christians to refuse to work on
Sundays. Today it handed down rulings barring student debt forgiveness
and upholding the right of Christians to discriminate against gay
people.</p>
<p>We seem to be well on our our way to the Christian theocracy the GOP
has in mind for us.</p>
<p>Most Democrats recognize that we are right on the edge of irrevocably
losing whatever shreds of democracy the Court’s Christian Nationalists
have not already torched. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer expressed
outrage when the Dobbs decision was announced and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/rare-rebuke-chief-justice-roberts-slams-schumer-threatening-comments-n1150036">lashed
out</a> with, “I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you,
Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.”
Despite the tough guy impression, Schumer has done little to provide
meaningful oversight of the Court and has resisted calls to expand
it.</p>
<p>Other Democratic Senators led by Massachusetts Senator <a
target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/14/house-and-senate-democrats-plan-bill-to-add-four-justices-to-supreme-court/">Ed
Markey</a> are calling for enlarging the number of Justices. In 2021 a
group of progressive <a
target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-progressives-call-schumer-expand-192011780.html">New
York legislators</a> called for enlarging it as well, appealing for
Democrats to give up the ridiculous pretense that the Court is
even-handed. “The Republican Party […] uses aggressive tactics to stack
the courts with right-wing ideologues, cultivated in their own parallel
legal ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party has fought to preserve
the myth of our apolitical judiciary,” stated an appeal organized by
State Assembly member elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani of the 36th district
(NY).</p>
<p>Regardless, President Biden remains firmly opposed to court
expansion.</p>
<p>You might recall that Biden embraced the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/joe-biden-return-to-campaign-trail/index.html">role</a>
of “healer in chief” when he won the Presidency. In retrospect, part of
the healing was to reassure Republicans he wasn’t going to tinker with
the Supreme Court. Biden created a 36-member <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/09/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-creating-the-presidential-commission-on-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states/">commission</a>
to look at the Court and its <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SCOTUS-Report-Final-12.8.21-1.pdf">final
report</a> infuriatingly cautioned that enlarging the court would call
the Court’s legitimacy into question.</p>
<p>The scope of the SCOTUS <em>Sugar Daddy</em> problem might have been
unknown at the time but the corruption and conflicts of interest of
several of its justices (and one insurrectionist spouse) were
well-known. Last year Democrats sponsored <a
target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3575349-democrats-introduce-bill-to-enact-term-limits-for-supreme-court-justices/">toothless</a>
performative legislation to impose term limits on Supreme Court
Justices, but the Constitution is the only mechanism that can actually
change a justice’s term of office.</p>
<p>Critics questioned the centrist composition of Biden’s commission,
its objectivity, and an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/commission-supreme-court-may-revive-reform/620969/">Atlantic
article</a> wrote it off with: “Biden wished to avoid weighing in on
this politically explosive proposal. The commission was his attempt to
avoid having to do so.”</p>
<p>Yesterday the President doubled down on his <em>do-nothing</em>
strategy, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-calls-us-colleges-consider-adversity-during-admission-process-2023-06-29/">telling</a>
an MSNBC reporter that, while the court “may do too much harm […] I
think if we start the process of trying to expand the court, we are
going to politicize it maybe forever, in a way that is not healthy.”
Once again, the 80 year-old President seemed to dismiss the severity of
the problem. And Biden’s given reason for refusing to expand the Court
only made a mockery of how politicized it is <em>already</em>.</p>
<p>To find similar upheavals in legal systems elsewhere you need only
travel to Central Asia, where Iran suffered similar rapid-fire decrees
by religious courts as the Shah’s dictatorship became a religious
dictatorship. Remember conservative Americans whining about “shariah
law” and “Islamofascism” in the Muslim world? These same Americans are
now all-too eager for a religious dictatorship here.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s rulings have enabled a dictatorship of sorts for
a shrinking, desperate demographic — white Christians. They and their
party have become oppressors of a long list of victims which include:
women of childbearing age, LGBTQ+ individuals, migrants, people of
color, Muslims, public school teachers, librarians, secular Americans,
liberal Jews, academics, union workers, environmental scientists, civil
rights activists, civil libertarians, police reformers, war resisters,
historians, sociologists, child psychologists, reproductive rights
physicians, and anyone even barely to the left of the John Birch
Society.</p>
<p>With today’s ruling barring college debt forgiveness, the Supreme
Court now adds young people to its hit list – young people who indebted
themselves in order to play the American <em>meritocracy</em> game. The
Court’s ruling should have been a surprise to no one. As savings and
loan, stock market, auto industry, insurance industry, bank, and
pandemic bailouts for corporations have <em>repeatedly</em>
demonstrated, <em>human</em> capital is never of equal importance. When
actual living, breathing humans experience real crises in their lives,
we discover all too quickly that, in America, you are on your own.</p>
<p>The issues America faces require political leadership people can
believe in. And secular America needs a fighter rather than a
healer.</p>
<p>Given Biden’s poor polling, his age, his gaffes, his reckless foreign
policy, his apparent lack of interest in tackling controversial
problems, a dangerous primary opponent (RFK Jr.), a wildcard from the
Left (Cornell West), and a stealth MAGA candidate who will probably run
under the <em>No Labels</em> label, the Democratic Party is going to
have a serious problem in 2024 if they stick with Biden.</p>
<p>It’s time for the DNC grownups to begin thinking of an alternative to
Biden in 2024. If the Democratic nominee won’t fight the GOP like he
<em>really means</em> it, a secular and diverse America is going to lose
even more than we have already.</p>
