<p><strong>PLEASE</strong> take action against a suite of repressive
legislation intended to police the internet, ban encryption, allow the
banning of online platforms, and impose firewalls and dragnet
surveillance on American internet users.</p>

<p>When a politician comes to you with legislation claiming to “protect
children” it’s wise to be cautious and read the legislation.</p>
<p>Republicans have perfected such appeals in hundreds of bills claiming
to “protect” children from history, social studies, vaccinations, and
sex education — just as an earlier generation “protected” children by
imposing segregation and fighting busing and fluoride. If Republicans
<em>really</em> cared about children, they’d pass comprehensive gun
control legislation, support universal childcare, and put safety belts
in school buses. But they don’t.</p>
<p>So it’s disheartening when Democrats join Republicans in trying to
destroy online privacy by policing the internet.</p>
<p>Connecticut Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal has had the internet
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.marketplace.org/2007/05/15/sex-offenders-still-lurking-myspace/">in
his sights</a> since at last 2007 when he called it “a playground for
predators.” Last year Blumenthal filed his <em>Kids Online Safety
Act</em> (KOSA) legislation and it immediately triggered some <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-11-28-letter-90-lgbtq-and-human-rights-organizations-oppose-kosa">well-deserved
outrage</a> from almost 100 civil rights organizations. You can read
their objections <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-11-28-letter-90-lgbtq-and-human-rights-organizations-oppose-kosa">here</a>
to a bill that would have made online platforms impose Chinese-style
“Great Firewall” controls on what children can access online and would
have mandated a “duty of care” to implement various types of
surveillance and data collection to “protect” children from “bad
actors.”</p>
<p>Still smarting from the criticism, Blumenthal went back to the
drawing board and this year, together with far right Tennessee Senator
Marcia Blackburn and equal numbers of center-right Democrats and
right-wing Republicans, filed <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/s1409/BILLS-118s1409is.pdf">S.1409</a>,
<em>An Act to Protect the Safety of Children on the Internet</em> (KOSA
2023). Unfortunately, this one is just as awful as the last.</p>
<p>KOSA’s Republican co-sponsors include: Marsha Blackburn; Katie Britt;
Shelley Capito; Bill Cassidy; John Cornyn; Mike Crapo; Steve Daines;
Joni Ernst; Lindsey Graham; Chuck Grassley; Cindy Hyde-Smith; James
Lankford; Cynthia Lummis; Roger Marshall; Markwayne Mullin; Lisa
Murkowski; James Risch; Marco Rubio; Rick Scott; Dan Sullivan; Roger
Wicker; and Todd Young.</p>
<p>It’s doubtful that the members of this right-wing crew are as
interested in protecting children as they are in policing the
internet.</p>
<p>Their Democrat fellow-travelers include: Tammy Baldwin; Richard
Blumenthal; Ben Cardin; Thomas Carper; Bob Casey; Chris Coons; Dick
Durbin; Maggie Hassan; John Hickenlooper; Tim Kaine; Mark Kelly; Amy
Klobuchar; Ben Lujan; Joe Manchin; Robert Menendez; Chris Murphy; Gary
Peters; Brian Schatz; Jeanne Shaheen; Mark Warner; Peter Welch; and
Sheldon Whitehouse.</p>
<p>KOSA comes at a time when states like Idaho have banned TikTok and
others are imposing laws to limit teen access to the internet. Of
course, the most glaring problems with the internet — hoaxes,
disinformation, and threats from the far right — are not easily
addressed because censorship violates the First Amendment.</p>
<p>But if you “protect” the children through surveillance and
censorship, then all the same surveillance and censorship infrastructure
can be used on grownups. In order to impose selective censorship on just
children, you’ll need some method of age verification. And here’s where
the trip down the slippery slope begins. Everyone — not just children —
will have to verify their age by providing personal information
typically not required for online services. Adults won’t really be able
to opt-out either; otherwise every 11 year-old would simply claim s/he’s
an adult.</p>
<p>According to the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/kids-online-safety-act-may-harm-minors-civil-society-groups-warn.html">ACLU,
EFF, and 90</a> other civil rights organizations, “age verification may
require users to provide platforms with personally identifiable
information such as date of birth and government-issued identification
documents, which can threaten users’ privacy, including through the risk
of data breaches, and chill their willingness to access sensitive
information online because they cannot do so anonymously. […] Rather
than age-gating privacy settings and safety tools to apply only to
minors, Congress should focus on ensuring that all users, regardless of
age, benefit from strong privacy protections by passing comprehensive
privacy legislation.”</p>
<p>Neither Republicans nor Democrats have done much to guarantee
citizens online privacy to the degree that the EU has, but center-right
Democrats and far-right Republicans sure love to invent ways to “protect
children” which inevitably destroy privacy and curtail civil
liberties.</p>
<p>Melissa Gira Grant writes in the <a
target="_blank" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/174786/republicans-fooling-democrats-kids-online-safety">New
Republic</a> that “KOSA […] has been billed as a new way to protect kids
from a more pervasive and more dangerous internet. But in reality, KOSA
hands powerful tools to the far right to further wage its war on kids,
whether it’s censoring education on racism or demonizing queer and trans
youth. Meanwhile, Democrats who support KOSA appear to either not have
noticed or not minded.”</p>
<p>KOSA requires online platforms to “take reasonable measures” to
“prevent and mitigate” harms to minors such as “anxiety, depression,
eating disorders, substance use disorders, and suicidal behaviors,” and
monitor “patterns of use that indicate or encourage addiction-like
behaviors” and “physical violence, online bullying, and harassment of
the minor.” State attorneys general are tasked to “prevent and mitigate”
and to prosecute platforms for failures to protect children. Describing
harms ambiguously much like anti-CRT legislation, state AGs can
prosecute platforms if children are “threatened or adversely affected by
the engagement of any person in a practice that violates this Act.”</p>

<p><em>Still from “Das Leben der Anderen” - Stasi surveillance in East
Germany</em></p>
<p>Even if well-intentioned, which it is not, the burden of surveillance
that this legislation imposes on internet platforms and the vast sweep
of monitoring hundreds of millions of users is something right out of
East Germany’s Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (the Stasi).</p>
<p>As Floridians are well aware, their governor and legislature regard
teaching Advanced Placement Black History as harmful, so that could end
up being censored. KOSA is a gift to the far-right, to white
supremacists, and to homophobes since it will effectively legitimize
anti-CRT, anti-LGBTQ+ and racist provisions like Florida’s
nationally.</p>
<p>Consequently, 90 civil liberties groups <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/kids-online-safety-act-may-harm-minors-civil-society-groups-warn.html">wrote</a>
to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warning that “online services
would face substantial pressure to over-moderate, including from state
Attorneys General seeking to make political points about <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-big-tech-turns-kids-trans">what
kind of information is appropriate</a> for young people. […] At a time
when books with LGBTQ+ themes are<a
target="_blank" href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">being
banned from school libraries</a> and people providing healthcare to
trans children are being falsely accused of ‘<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/child-abuse-grooming-language.html">grooming</a>,’
KOSA would cut off another vital avenue of access to information for
vulnerable youth.”</p>
<p>In addition to the mandated censorship and surveillance, internet
platforms would be required to file <a
target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/the-kids-online-safety-act-isnt-all-right-critics-say/">annual
public reports</a> itemizing risks to children and listing their
prevention and mitigation efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>an assessment of the extent to which the platform is likely to be
accessed by minors</li>
<li>a description of the commercial interests of the covered platform in
use by minors</li>
<li>an accounting of the number of individuals using the covered
platform reasonably believed to be minors</li>
<li>an assessment of the reasonably foreseeable risk of harms to minors
posed by the covered platform</li>
<li>an assessment of how recommendation systems and targeted advertising
systems can contribute to harms to minors</li>
<li>a description of whether and how the covered platform uses system
design features that increase, sustain, or extend use of a product or
service by a minor</li>
<li>a description of whether, how, and for what purpose the platform
collects or processes categories of personal data that may cause
reasonably foreseeable risk of harms to minors</li>
<li>an evaluation of the efficacy of safeguards for minors</li>
<li>an evaluation of any other relevant matters of public concern over
risk of harms to minors</li>
</ul>
<p>The specificity of these burdensome reporting and data collection
requirements is remarkable, given these same legislators’ lack of
interest in accountability for police officers, Pentagon contractors, or
oil and gas companies.</p>

<p><em>Enigma machine: it’s encryption was eventually broken</em></p>
<h4 id="kosa-and-worse"><strong>KOSA, and worse</strong></h4>
<p>KOSA is only one of several malignant pieces of legislation intended
to police the internet. Several others do so at the cost of effectively
banning encryption.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1199">STOP
CSAM ACT</a> from Illinois Democratic Senator Dick Durbin requires
online platforms to snoop on their users to detect child pornography.
While this makes it easier to prosecute Dark Web operators, the
legislation also depends on disabling data encryption to permit snooping
by law enforcement and the user’s own platform. Effectively banning
encryption is such a radical step that it explains why STOP CSAM was
quietly sneaked into the [annual] National Defense Authorization Act,
which is often passed without much scrutiny by both political parties.
In addition to breaking encryption, and like KOSA, STOP CSAM would also
mandate a take-down mechanism that can be used by far-right politicians
to remove any kind of content considered harmful to children, including
resources for LGBTQ+ teens or African-American curriculum.</li>
<li>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1207">EARN
IT ACT</a> from South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsay Graham is
ostensibly to “protect” children from child pornography. But once again,
it does more to advance dragnet surveillance than its stated purpose.
This bill permits the scanning of your online family photos, messages,
and emails. And of course in order to do that your provider has to
disable your encryption.</li>
<li>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1080">Cooper-Davis
Act</a>, an amendment to the Controlled Substances Act from Kansas
Republican Senator Roger Marshall, is intended to monitor the online use
and sale of controlled substances, particularly fentanyl. This
legislation requires your internet provider to monitor your
communications and proactively report suspected drug use or drug sales
to law enforcement. No warrants are necessary! Aside from violating the
Fourth Amendment, the bill also relies on disabling encryption to enable
the snooping.</li>
<li>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686">RESTRICT
ACT</a>, sponsored by Democratic Senator Mark Warner, claims to target
data collection by foreign governments. It was specifically intended to
ban TikTok but it also penalizes users for employing Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) or side-loading (unconventional installation) of apps to
circumvent censorship.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take action against all of them!</strong></p>
