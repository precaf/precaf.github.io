It is surprising that more high-school dropout CIA/NSA contractors making \$200K a year haven't come forward like Edward Snowden -- but perhaps the money and the Hawaiian paradise are intended to salve itchy consciences. Though elected officials and, shamefully, the press routinely call whistle-blowers "self-styled" or "narcissistic," and their motives, stability, and loyalties questioned -- rarely are the ethical issues surrounding the disclosures taken at face value. 

It is instructive to recall a time when the United States actually admired whistle-blowers. I found this account, which was all the more interesting to me because it takes place literally in our own backyard. It might be worth re-telling the story for readers of your paper:

Highlights:

> "In the winter of 1777, months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the American warship Warren was anchored outside of Providence, R.I. On board, 10 revolutionary sailors and marines met in secret — not to plot against the king’s armies, but to discuss their concerns about the commander of the Continental Navy, Commodore Esek Hopkins. They knew the risks: Hopkins came from a powerful family; his brother was a former governor of Rhode Island and a signer of the declaration.
>
> "Hopkins had participated in the torture of captured British sailors; he 'treated prisoners in the most inhuman and barbarous manner,' his subordinates wrote in a petition."
>
> "One whistle-blower, a Marine captain named John Grannis, was selected to present the petition to the Continental Congress, which voted on March 26, 1777, to suspend Hopkins from his post."

Fortunately, many in the fragile, new nation realized that "misconduct" and cover-ups could easily undermine a budding democracy. The first whistle-blower protections were passed almost immediately following attempts to quash an investigation. Here it is, in language that holds up even today:

> "Resolved, That it is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other the inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds, or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these stats, which may come to their knowledge."
