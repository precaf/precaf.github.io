<p>Massachusetts may sound like an odd state for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/01/massachusetts-board-of-education-approves-alma-del-mar-charter-school-expansion-plan-in-new-bedford.html%0A">Republican</a> policies to be implemented by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/01/massachusetts-board-of-education-approves-alma-del-mar-charter-school-expansion-plan-in-new-bedford.html">Democrats</a>. Yet as I write this the “Democratic” Bristol County DA is lobbying for the Republican governor’s “Dangerousness” [mass incarceration] legislation. And the latest bipartisan attack on public education is from comrporate Democrats — Dartmouth state Rep. Christopher Markey and Westport Rep. Paul Schmid, whose pro-charter school bill, <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/HD4174">HD4174</a> turns state education law on its head to pay for <a target="_blank" href="http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/accountability/report/school.aspx?fycode=2018&amp;orgcode=04090205">Alma del Mar</a> with public funds. As a charter, the school is less accountable to the public than to its <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826130225/http://almadelmar.org:80/about-us/meet-our-team/board-of-trustees/">trustees</a> or its corporate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/ma/alma-del-mar-foundation-inc.html">board</a>.</p>
<p>Though frequently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20190223/jack-spillane-could-first-alma-del-mar-also-become-neighborhood-school">described</a> as an <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191202083718/https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-01-22/charting-a-new-course-a-charter-school-experiment-in-massachusetts">experiment</a>, Alma del Mar’s charter is just another skirmish in a greater war for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opcHQ_v6PuU">privatization of American schools</a>. Nationally, charter schools have <a target="_blank" href="https://networkforpubliceducation.org/asleepatthewheel/">already fleeced</a> taxpayers to the tune of at least $1 billion. The <a target="_blank" href="https://npeaction.org/hijacked-by-billionaires-how-the-super-rich-buy-elections-to-undermine-public-schools/">Network for Public Education Action</a> has documented the role of the super-rich in buying legislative approval for charter schools. Their ultimate goal is privatization. Now New Bedford in in their crosshairs.</p>
<p>HD4147 is opposed by numerous local community groups and organized labor, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nbcsos/">NBCSOS</a> (New Bedford Coalition to Save our Schools), the Greater <a target="_blank" href="https://gsmlaborcouncil.org/news/new-bedford-coalition-save-our-schools">New Bedford Labor Council</a> and the NAACP. This corporate giveaway is the work of a couple of tony suburban Democrats working with the Republican governor and business interests to usher charter schools into Massachusetts through a back door.</p>
<p>In a recent op-ed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/opinion/20190518/guest-view-new-bedford-delegation-please-support-neighborhood-charter-agreement">co-signed by numerous corporate interests</a>, Anthony Sapienza, who heads up the New Bedford Economic Development Council (NBEDC), assures us that the legislation is a “first-of-its-kind partnership” and “a solution that is critical to the stability of all other public schools and the city’s finances.” <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nbedc.org/news/opinion-your-view-excellence-in-all-schools-requires-reforms-to-funding-and-approach/">Sapienza</a> gushes about “neighborhood schools,” arguing that giving Alma del Mar to a corporation is all part of “tangibly advancing strategies for sustainable and shared growth” in New Bedford. Alma del Mar will be a neighborhood school only in the narrowest sense — just as Stop and Shop is your neighborhood green grocer only in the narrowest sense. To echo the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nbedc.org/">NBEDC</a>’s slogan, Alma del Mar will be “open for business.”</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opcHQ_v6PuU</p>
<p>Sapienza rather disingenuously frames the question as a choice between the city raising $8 million to expand an existing school by 600 students — or giving away $4 million to a private corporation to outsource another 450 desks. Since Alma del Mar was built on city property at a cost of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20160621/alma-del-mar-ready-to-go-with-new-building-and-grade-7-this-fall">$16 million</a>, the real question is whether any sane person thinks New Bedford will save $4 million — an amount less than 1% of the city’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20190508/mayor-jon-mitchell-unveils-401m-city-budget-for-fy2020">FY2020</a> city budget — by giving away $16 million to a private entity.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/HD4174.pdf">HD4147</a> is plainly a raw deal for city residents — especially when you actually read the legislation yourself.</p>
<p>Section 2 of the bill says that — for purposes of all the <em>expensive</em> stuff — the school “shall be considered a public school.” But — to the great delight of the corporations pushing the bill — “for all other purposes, including but not limited to chapters 71A and 71B of the General Laws, Alma del Mar Charter School, <em>including its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20190319/update-new-bedford-to-vote-on-mou-and-kempton-school">second campus</a></em>, shall be considered a Commonwealth Charter School.”</p>
<p>And Schmid and Markey are giving them both away.</p>
<p>Section 3 of the Markey-Schmid legislation gives the city permission to dispose of the physical buildings as it sees fit: “Notwithstanding any contrary provision in or interpretation of section 15A of chapter 40 of the General Laws, the School Committee may transfer custody of 135 Shawmut Avenue [the former Horatio A. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20190319/update-new-bedford-to-vote-on-mou-and-kempton-school">Kempton School</a>] to the City of New Bedford pursuant to a simple majority vote stating that said property is no longer needed by the New Bedford Public Schools.”</p>
<p>In what alternate reality does a school district <em>give away</em> $16 million of property because no further use is foreseen? The answer is — only in the world of corporatized education.</p>
<p>Section 4 provides the corporate school with guaranteed taxpayer-funded tuition payments. Section 5 cuts the public out of any review process for the transfers in the preceding sections.</p>
