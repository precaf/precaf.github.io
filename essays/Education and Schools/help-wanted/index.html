<p>I have been afraid of this for some time. The Dartmouth Schools are
now indisputably under attack by right-wing fanatics. If you are a
liberal or progressive who doesn’t want to see the banning of books and
diversity programs come to our schools — and better yet, you are the
parent of children in the school system — <strong>now is the
time</strong> to stand up for those pretty words on the sign sitting on
your front lawn — and run for School Committee.</p>
<p>The present <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dartmouth.school/domain/336">Dartmouth School
Committee</a> consists of: conservative Chris Oliver; ultra-conservative
and would-be book-banner John Nunes; liberals Mary Waite, Kathleen
Amaral, and Shannon Jenkins. Kathleen Amaral and Mary Waite’s seats are
up for re-election this year. Mary Waite has not filed papers. So
assuming Kathleeen Amaral keeps her seat, it is Mary Waite’s now being
<a
target="_blank" href="https://dartmouth.theweektoday.com/article/four-running-school-committee-candidates-file-april-election/62024">challenged</a>
by Lynn Turner, Troy Tufano, and Erica Lyn Morney.</p>
<p>Now that we find ourselves in the George Santos era, it’s worth
knowing something about the increasing number of reprobates running for
office. So here’s my best attempt at a survey of the School Committee
candidates.</p>
<p>I still don’t know much about Ms. Morney, so if anyone has any
information to share, please contact me and I will update this post.</p>
<p>However, I <em>am</em> familiar with Lynn Turner — whom I wrote about
the <em>last</em> time she ran for the School Committee. <strong>Turner
is an evangelical book-burner who wants to dismantle diversity
programs</strong>. I looked into <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/maga-candidate">Turner’s
background</a> last year and also reported on her <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/maga-speaks">campaign remarks</a> at
a candidate forum. She is a two-faced piece of work who literally quotes
Martin Luther King as she tries to undermine everything he stood
for.</p>
<p>Joining her this year is Troy Tufano, a self-described <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-tufano-9a3a01108?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F">political
consultant</a> who has dabbled in both Republican and Democratic
politics. Regardless of whatever party he is enrolled in, judging from
his abandoned Twitter account <strong>Troy Tufano is also an evangelical
book-burner who wants to dismantle diversity programs</strong>. Besides
Tufano’s <em>bromances</em> with domestic right-wing personalities like
Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Ben <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/11/us/ben-shapiro-bbc-interview-intl/index.html">Shapiro</a>,
Charlie <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kirk">Kirk</a>,
and prosperity gospel mega-preacher Joel <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/876802/come-hell-or-high-water-inside-joel-osteen-s-60-million-megachurch-empire">Osteen</a>,
Tufano has frequently <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/realtroytufano">re-Tweeted</a> European
neo-fascists like: Ragnar Gardarsson of the Danish <em>Nye
Borgerlige</em> Party; and Marine LePen of the <em>Rassemblement
National Party</em>. Tufano has also retweeted conspiracy theories, such
as the long-discredited accusation that the Clintons had Vince Foster
killed. If Tufano’s tweets should mysteriously disappear during the
run-up to the town election, you can find a <a
target="_blank" href="https://app.box.com/s/js56q2u4bx4llf2zxw1bd6hdx3hebayt">zipfile</a>
of screen shots <a
target="_blank" href="https://app.box.com/s/js56q2u4bx4llf2zxw1bd6hdx3hebayt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dartmouth’s Town elections are only two months away. This year <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.town.dartmouth.ma.us/town-clerk/files/2023-calendar">the
town election is April 4th</a>. I hope that kind and decent people will
step up. Candidates need to pick up filing papers at Town Hall no later
than February 10th, collect 50 signatures (double or triple that in case
of challenges), and submit the paperwork to the Town Clerk by February
14th.</p>
<p>Especially if you are the parent of children in the Dartmouth
Schools, now is the time to step up. That sign on your lawn is nice and
all, but British social philosopher and Liberal John Stuart Mill said it
best: “Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good
men should look on and do nothing.”</p>
