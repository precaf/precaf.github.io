<p>I have about 30 unfinished plays. As I learn more about plays that
“work” I have concluded that most of these moldering first attempts are
probably not worth salvaging, although a few could work with major
rewrites. But I’ve also realized that maybe I should just say
<em>kaddish</em> for my characters and start from scratch.</p>
<p>Together with the many <em>plays</em> I’ve read are books on
structure, plot, character, and dramaturgy. Of the ambitious
<em>compendia</em>, Richard Toscan’s <em>Playwriting Seminars 2.0</em>
is very good. And Louis E. Catron’s <em>Elements of Playwriting</em> was
also very helpful. Lenora Inez Brown’s <em>The Art of Active
Dramaturgy</em> talks about how a dramaturg works with a playwright and
a theatre company to tune a play for production. In my <em>head</em> I
know a lot about what makes a good play, yet for all the books and
writing workshops, I’ve never really known <em>how</em> (or been
confident enough) to tackle the complex <em>process</em> of
<em>completing</em> a play. Now that the light is dawning somewhat, it’s
clear that if you know even <em>something</em> about process, you will
write much more confidently.</p>
<p>Recently I have been listening to playwriting podcasts. The most
helpful (to me) of these is by a young Australian playwright, Emily
Sheehan. Her <em>Playwright’s Process</em> podcast is just that: full of
wisdom and ideas for tackling <em>process</em> step by step. Another
podcast I found helpful is Jonah Knight’s <em>Theatrically
Speaking</em>, which focuses on writing plays that can <em>actually be
produced</em> as well as suggestions for submitting plays. There are
numerous podcasts from the British National Theatre which are excellent.
Another, <em>Not True, but Useful,</em> is a British podcast that
highlights the work of a couple of roving theatre producers and
designers. Add to these: <em>Hey, Playwright; Women Playwrights Podcast;
Playwright’s Spotlight; Necessary Exposure; Not in Print; Pint Size
Playwriting; Playwright to Playwright; Playwright’s Horizon; Playwriting
Real-Life; The Cultivated Playwright; The Subtext; Women and
Playwriting;</em> and many more than I have time to listen to.</p>
<p>If you are in the same boat (dinghy, inflatable raft) as I am,
hopefully some of these mentions are useful. The world may need major
repair. But it has always relied on good theatre to remind us of our
humanity.</p>
