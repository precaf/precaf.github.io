<p>Americans don’t fully recognize the importance of labor or the
potential combined political power of working people. Or maybe we have
simply allowed ourselves to be persuaded that that’s a “far-left”
viewpoint.</p>
<p>Somehow it’s only class warfare when workers make their demands
known.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, and in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/May-Day-international-observance">Europe</a> particularly,
May Day (or International Workers’ Day) is celebrated with displays of
unity and power, such as today’s protests in France against President
Macron’s decree raising the French retirement age.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, GOP-controlled states are <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.epi.org/publication/child-labor-laws-under-attack/">rolling
back</a> worker protections, including those barring child labor.</p>
<p>For the most part it is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/30/1095729592/what-is-may-day-history">anathema</a> —
or down-right “communist” — to point out the degree of exploitation of
workers in America.</p>
<p>A new <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Unbroken-Chains-Trafficking-American-Economy/dp/0807006777">book</a> by
Melissa Hope Ditmore, a scholar who focuses on sex trafficking, makes
the observation that sex and human trafficking are not all that
different from the routine exploitation of workers. “Trafficking into
agricultural, industry, and domestic work has always received scant
attention compared with trafficking into sex work, despite its enormous
scale and impact on the economy,” Ditmore writes.</p>
<p>Many of these most difficult jobs are still exempted from Social
Security benefits created under the New Deal — which incidentally
occurred during Jim Crow. Domestic laborers, nannies, lettuce pickers,
elder care workers, house cleaners, teacher’s aides, and
non-professional workers in the medical industry are all low-paid,
mainly female and, more often than not, exploited. This extends to
immigrants and the working poor who toil in the so-called “Gig economy”
— basically piecework jobs that exclude them from full benefits.</p>
<p>In the worst days of the pandemic, the elderly and
immune-compromised, in particular, depended on “gig economy” delivery
services. We depended upon checkout clerks who did not have the luxury
of working from home. These and the millions of healthcare workers who
went to work every day, running the risk of contracting a virus for
which there was then no immunization or treatment, were the real heroes
of the day.</p>
<p>All over America, often in abysmal and unsafe working conditions,
agricultural workers kept supply chains running so that the more
privileged could continue to buy meats and vegetables even as the
pandemic raged.</p>
<p>And across the country, particularly in Florida, being a teacher has
now become a virtually impossible job for those who believe in teaching
the truth and protecting vulnerable students. This is a profession that
has never been adequately compensated, but is now literally under
attack.</p>
<p>We are in the habit of reflexively thanking servicemen for
participating in fairly questionable foreign wars and adventures, but we
never thank the real heroes for their service. So in the absence of
widespread May Day celebrations, I’m raising a toast tonight to the
workers of the world and the power and remuneration they so richly
deserve.</p>
