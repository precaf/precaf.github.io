<p>I recently received a couple of replies from friends mentioning both
Artificial Intelligence and social media. AI and internet technology are
often treated as separate disciplines, but the two have now fused as
search engines, help desk software, and medical diagnostic and other
research tools increasingly incorporate sophisticated neural network
processing and natural language models.</p>
<p>Both a novelty and a threat, AI has now blown past the <a
target="_blank" href="https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/turing-test">Turing
Test</a> – a test of human verisimiltude – as we are increasingly
bombarded with wholly invented images, almost-convincing “scholarship,”
and computer-generated replies to human social media posts.</p>
<p>Since <em>to some degree</em> AI performs certain tasks like a human,
this now calls into question our value as real humans. Under Capitalism,
economic vulnerability has now become sharpened by a very specific kind
of <em>existential</em> fear.</p>
<p>Both of my friends’ observations stand by themselves so I will simply
reproduce them here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The bigger problem is what to do about lack of regulation of a
technology that poses a threat on a number of levels in the name of a
sacred freedom. The technology has long since outpaced societal
regulation to prevent its misuse and harm and that needs to be
redressed, not just offending platforms boycotted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While Stephen Hawkin thought AI was our biggest threat, and it may
well be, I find it sad that we collectively refuse to see that our fears
that machines will have no use for us and do us in are also a projection
of our culture’s attitude towards many humans and all of the non-human
world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the first reader, computer technology poses an intractable
<em>regulatory</em> issue pitting personal freedoms against the
uncontrolled forces of technological development. To the second, it is a
<em>moral</em> issue. AI awakens human fears of suddenly finding
ourselves lower on the food chain. And since AI calls into question our
value as humans, we are reminded of how inhuman we have been to the
world around us: to other humans, animals, and our environment.</p>
<p>These are both apt and wise observations. But both are framed in
terms of the present realities of our economic and legal systems.
Neither observation identifies a particular culprit or a possible
solution.</p>
<p>Yet computer technology today poses precisely the same problems that
19th Century British <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/06/the-luddites-were-right">Luddites</a>
encountered with the introduction of automation and steam powering of
textile factories.</p>
<p>Contrary to the common understanding of the term, “Luddites” were not
technophobes who disliked technology they could not comprehend. These
weavers and spinners knew <em>exactly</em> how the technology worked.
Rather, Luddites resented that the new technology was being forced upon
them by industrialists bent on destroying their livelihoods because they
now owned all the means of production and distribution. For the
Luddites, this was a fight for economic survival, not an effort to keep
up with technology.</p>
<p>As early as 1811 Luddites in the English Midlands began destroying
textile factories and almost immediately became targets of both private
retaliation and state repression. There were mass hangings and
deportations to Australia. Children, rather than adult artisans, were
soon put to work in these factories. The Industrial Revolution was so
grim and foul that Charles Dickens wrote about it and Karl Marx
developed a whole theory around it.</p>
<p><img src="child-labor.jpg" /></p>
<p>But even Karl Marx showed little sympathy for the Luddites. After
all, for him economic progress was human progress; feudalism replaced
barbarism; Capitalism replaced feudalism; and socialism would ultimately
replace Capitalism. Opposing technological development wasn’t the answer
for either 19th Century Marxists or Capitalists. And for 20th Century
Capitalists and Communists alike, technology was practically
fetishized.</p>
<p>Many of us internalize a fatalistic view of technology forced upon us
by billionaires: we regard the introduction of new technologies as
inevitable and we struggle to keep up and pay for it. We rarely ponder
what life would be like if we actually had a voice in deciding how to
use new technology. Instead, it is always up to the courts to address
wrongs and abuses, and the courts can’t keep up either. But in any case,
this is the wrong institution to regulate technology.</p>
<p>But back to Marx. Marx had no crystal ball, though he certainly had a
keen mind. But for all that intellect he also had no idea that two
feudal societies, Russia and China, would skip right over Capitalism
directly into a broken form of socialism. Marx never fully connected
slavery or racism with colonialism; for him slavery was simply a more
extreme form of theft of labor value and, in the end, just another
“economic category.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Direct slavery is just as much the pivot of bourgeois industry as
machinery, credits, etc. Without slavery you have no cotton; without
cotton you have no modern industry. It is slavery that gave the colonies
their value; it is the colonies that created world trade, and it is
world trade that is the pre-condition of large-scale industry. Thus,
slavery is an economic category of the greatest importance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be up to later writers (Cedric Robinson, W.E.B. DuBois,
C.L.R. James, Eric Williams) to make the case that Capitalism could
never have existed without colonialism and racism.</p>
<p>But Marx <em>was</em> right about at least two things: (1) the labor
of workers is being stolen; and (2) the end of Capitalism will involve
changes in both production and social relations. After Capitalism’s time
is finally up, capital (and this includes technology and intellectual
property) will pass from the exclusive hands of industrialists, venture
capitalists, and billionaires and become a commonly-owned,
socially-controlled resource. A social good.</p>
<p>With the end of Capitalism – at least the predatory, completely
unregulated Stage 4 variant the GOP champions – we all will finally have
a say in how capital / technology / IP can be used – and for what social
ends.</p>
<p>No more Murdochs (FOX), Musks (Twitter), Zuckerbergs (Facebook), or
Sam Altmans or Peter Thiels (ChatGPT) changing <em>your</em> world.</p>
<p>But to get there we’ll have to change <em>theirs</em>.</p>
