With the help of [more than 6,000 lobbyists](http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/362796-analysis-more-than-6000-lobbyists-have-worked-on) the 1% of the 1% — America's super-rich — managed to ram through a new tax code in the U.S. Congress designed entirely for themselves. Here in the Commonwealth similar looters are unhappy the "little people" have been fighting back. 

The [RaiseUp Coalition](https://raiseupma.org/press-release-corporate-lobbyist-hypocrisy/) — a broad coalition of workers and social justice groups in Massachusetts — succeeded in getting the so-called "Millionaire's Tax" on the 2018 state ballot. It took thousands of hours of ordinary people standing in the freezing cold or drizzle, and being chased from supermarket parking lots, to gather the signatures. Now, however, the richest of the rich are trying to have the ballot initiative blocked — by taking away our right to vote on it.

A complaint before the [Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court](http://cltg.org/cltg/clt2017/docs/17-10-03_SJC_Brief.pdf) claims Attorney General Maura Healey and State Secretary William Galvin overstepped their authority by permitting what is essentially a progressive income tax to be added to the ballot. 

Healy and Galvin are being sued by Christopher Anderson, Westford, President of the Massachusetts High Technology Council, Inc. ("MHTC"); Christopher Carlozzi, Malden, State Director of the National Federation of Independent Business (“NFIB”); Richard C. Lord, Peabody, President and Chief Executive Officer of Associated Industries of Massachusetts (“AIM”); Eileen McAnneny, Melrose, President of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation (“Foundation”); and Daniel O’Connell, Boston, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership (“MACP”).

When these lobbying groups were pocketing massive tax breaks not one of them one was screaming "Class Warfare!" But now when called upon to pay their fair share, well, things are quite different. [Fourteen members](https://raiseupma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Companies-Receiving-Public-Benefits.pdf) of the Mass High Tech Council alone have managed to extort $144.7 million in tax breaks from the state — and the **$150 million in salaries of the executives who run these companies were paid for almost entirely by taxpayers**. Nevertheless, taxpayer largesse was never enough for these parasites.	

**If you are a voter**, please [sign the RaiseUp petition](http://action.raiseupma.org/page/s/defend-the-fair-share-amendment) to demand that the tax initiative stays on the ballot.

**And if you are a legislator** — just pass the Millionaire's Tax! If the people's house were really doing the people's work we wouldn't need ballot initiatives like this.
