<p>On August 30th at 6PM at the UMASS Law School in Dartmouth voters from the 9th Congressional District will have a chance to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/resist-new-bedford/events/241601873/">meet Congressman Bill Keating</a>. As I have noted <a target="_blank" href="/Democratic%20Party/keating-voting/">previously</a>, Keating is not much of a Liberal and his views on immigration, healthcare, consumer protection, and foreign policy are substantially at odds with many Democrats and <em>completely</em> at odds with the new Massachusetts Democratic Party platform. In fact, <a target="_blank" href="/Democratic%20Party/voting-enemy/">on immigration especially</a>, Bill Keating seems to go out of his way to vote with Republicans.</p>
<p>Yes, our Congressman has some explaining to do – not only his own voting record, but also the positions of the <a target="_blank" href="https://newdemocratcoalition-himes.house.gov/">New Democrat Coalition</a>, of which he is a <a target="_blank" href="https://newdemocratcoalition-himes.house.gov/members">member</a>. This is one more new Democratic grouping resisting progressive legislation that has some membership overlap with the openly conservative <a target="_blank" href="https://bluedogcaucus-costa.house.gov/">Blue Dog</a> Coalition.</p>
<p>Keating is either a relic of the Democratic Party’s past, or a symbol of its unchanged, and doomed, future.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="keating.pdf">The PDF in this link</a> might be useful for anyone in the audience on August 30th with an opportunity to jump in line and ask Mr. Keating a question.</p>
<p>Voters need answers on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immigration</strong><br />
You have broken with Democrats to vote for several GOP anti-immigrant bills. H.R.3009 punishes Sanctuary Cities. H.R.4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, restricts absorption of Syrian refugees. Most recently you voted for H.R.3004, “Kate’s Law,” which takes a harsh but largely symbolic stand against desperate people who re-enter the United States. The candidate statement on immigration you provided “On the Issues” sounds like it was written by Donald Trump or Jeff Sessions. Can you explain why your positions are so divergent from mainstream Democrats?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discriminatory Auto Financing</strong><br />
You and a minority of House Democrats broke with your own party to vote for Republican sponsored H.R.1737, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act. This bill prohibited consumers – particularly minorities – from suing auto lenders who violated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules against discrimination in lending. The bill takes the unusual step of preventing disclosures of violations with Freedom of Information Act requests. The NAACP, the Urban League, La Raza, the Consumers Union, and many others, were opposed. Why did you vote to preserve and protect discrimination? And why did you vote against consumers?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medicare for All</strong><br />
One hundred and sixteen Democrats, including your colleagues in the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, Katherine Clark, Jim McGovern, and Michael Capuano, have co-sponsored H.R.676, John Conyers’ Medicare for All Act. Why are you not a co-sponsor of this bill? And is there another plan to expand care to Americans that you WOULD support?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>College Tuition</strong><br />
Twenty-seven Democrats, including your Rhode Island colleagues in the House, David Cicilline and Jim Langevin, have co-sponsored H.R.1880, Pramila Jaypal’s College for All Act. Why are you not a co-sponsor of this bill, one which puts into action what Massachusetts Democrats just voted into our platform last June?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private Prisons</strong><br />
Two members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation – McGovern and Clark – support H.R.3227, Raul Grijalva’s Justice is Not for Sale Act. At a time Republicans are trying to re-institute discredited justice and prison practices, and pushing privatization, including prisons, schools, and even the war in Afghanistan, why won’t you support this bill – one that places restrictions on private prisons?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mortgage Lending</strong><br />
You and 63 Democrats broke with your own party to vote for Republican sponsored H.R.3192, the Homebuyers Assistance Act. This bill was a hit with the American Bankers Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Home Builders lobby, but it prohibited consumers from suing mortgage lenders who violated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosure requirements under the Truth in Lending Act. You don’t believe in amnesty for immigrants. Why an amnesty for mortgage lenders?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abortion</strong><br />
One hundred and twenty-one Democrats, including you, support H.R.771, the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage. Thank you for that. However, DNC chair Tom Perez and DCCC chair Ray Lujan, as well as some in the New Democrat Coalition, of which you and Seth Moulton are members, argue for “flexibility” on abortion and against abortion as a litmus test. But shouldn’t abortion rights be a non-negotiable plank for Democrats? A litmus test, if you will?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citizens United</strong><br />
In light of the tremendous amount of money now being spent on elections at all levels and ballot questions from 2012 and 2014 showing over 70% of Massachusetts voters supporting a Constitutional amendment to restrict rights to natural persons and to take money out of elections – why are you not a co-sponsor of H.J.Res.48, which would do precisely that?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Voter Registration</strong><br />
One hundred and sixteen Democrats, including four Massachusetts Representatives – McGovern, Tsongas, Neal, and Clark – support H.R.2840, David Cicilline’s Automatic Voter Registration Act. At a time when Republicans are making it more difficult, not easier to vote, what’s stopping you from supporting this bill?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Taxing Wall Street Speculation</strong><br />
Two members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation – McGovern and Clark – already support H.R.1144, Keith Ellison’s Inclusive Prosperity Act. This Wall Street Speculation fee is a fraction of a percent tax on stocks, bonds, and financial derivatives, will be used to fund public university tuition, and is offset by tax credits. Can we get you on record tonight as supporting this bill?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NAFTA</strong><br />
Two members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation – McGovern and Moulton – have co-signed Representatives Bill Pascrell and Debbie Dingell’s letter urging the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to ensure that the NAFTA renegotiation process remains open and transparent. – Why not you?</p>
