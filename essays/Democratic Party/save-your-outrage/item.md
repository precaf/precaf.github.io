Save your outrage for the outdated electoral process, Florida election fraud and the Supreme Court appointment of a president. The Greens have comparatively little political influence; they can't automatically get on a ballot or qualify for matching election funds. So let's be clear: it wasn't Nader that elected Bush in 2002.

Democrats seem to have forgotten who they are. Some of the recent crop of Democratic candidates like Joe Lieberman were virtually indistinguishable from Republicans. John Kerry, with his support for the Iraq War, NAFTA, and the Patriot Act, and now with his "Band of Brothers" show, goes out of his way to be GOP-Lite. Democratic candidates like Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich have run spirited campaigns, yet have not received much support from their own party.

If Democrats won't give voters a choice, third parties like the Greens will. Don't blame Nader, Dean, or Kucinich. Blame a party that's driving away its own membership.
