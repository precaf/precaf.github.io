Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home. 

Unfortunately, your home town doesn't make it easy to participate in local elections. Did you know that your town election is in about a week? Can you find it listed prominently on your town's website? Did a town clerk post a sample ballot? Do you even know who or what is on the ballot? 

I can't help you with much more than the dates, unfortunately. Call your town clerk for the rest.
