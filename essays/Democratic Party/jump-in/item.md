By now most of us have found plenty of organizations that need our help, our voices, and our money. We [make our daily calls](https://dailyaction.org/), our [targeted calls](http://thesixtyfive.org/weeklyCTA), write our representatives, and even take to the streets on occasion. We help out candidates in [swing states](https://swingleft.org/) or those like [Tom Brock](https://vote4tombrock.com/), [Jon Ossoff](https://electjon.com/) or [Josh King](https://joshking.ngpvanhost.com/) in Red State districts that show promise.

Some of us belong to organizations like [Our Revolution](https://www.ourrevolution.com/) and [Democracy for America](http://democracyforamerica.com/), which raise money for, vet, and endorse candidates.

But most of these efforts take place hundreds of miles away from home.

If you are looking for activist groups you can jump into right here in SouthCoast MA, check out:

[Indivisible Southeast Mass](https://www.facebook.com/events/378728735832229/) - a largely New Bedford based Indivisible affiliated group which meets at the NB Library on Pleasant Street

[Marching Forward](https://www.facebook.com/groups/987388698061779/) - a group of approximately 300 people in the Dartmouth area also affiliated with Indivisible who meet periodically at the Dartmouth Grange

If you are especially concerned about immigration issues:

[Immigrants Assistance Center](https://www.facebook.com/Immigrants-Assistance-Center-Inc-1408028066122397/) - New Bedford MA

And for a variety of economic and social justice issues my old friends:

[Coalition for Social Justice](https://www.facebook.com/coalitionforsocialjustice/) - New Bedford & Fall River

You've got your choice. Now take the plunge.
