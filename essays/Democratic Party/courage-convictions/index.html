<p>Joe Biden’s and the Democratic Party’s uncritical support for
Israel’s war on Gaza will probably cost them the next election. Growing
support for third party candidates will also do Biden no favors. Just as
the Democrats are taking it on the chin, a broad coalition of
well-organized and well-financed far-right and Christian Nationalist
organizations have announced a national “reorg” of the judiciary, the
Presidency, the civil service, and they have their sights set on
far-reaching legislative changes.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.project2025.org/">Project 2025</a> and the Trump
campaign’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47">Agenda 47</a>
both represent nothing less than an ambitious, detailed neofascist plan
to jettison what’s left of America’s secular democracy and replace it
with authoritarian rule and Christian Nationalism.</p>
<p>But if Democrats can’t hold the Presidency, then the damage to
American democracy, such as it is, will have come from a party that has
failed to capture the confidence of voters and has also managed to
alienate even its own members.</p>
<p>Completely divorced from issues of his age, mental fitness and <a
target="_blank" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">electability</a>,
a significant number of Democratic voters are furious that Joe Biden,
who <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Nrv5izaTs">describes
himself</a> at every opportunity as a Zionist, has been complicit in a
deliberate genocide that has moved from destroying an entire
population’s housing and slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians, to
harrying millions of people all over their open-air concentration camp,
to now starving them to death and blocking food and supplies from
reaching them.</p>
<p>Channeling outrage among Democrats of conscience, and with no
Democratic candidates courageous enough to reject unconditional support
for Israel, “Uncommitted” campaigns were organized in several states to
use the Democratic primaries themselves to register protest. In <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/07/hawaii-democratic-caucus-results-biden-uncommitted/72876598007/">Hawaii</a>,
over 29% of Democrats voted “Uncommitted” in the presidential primary.
In <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/05/super-tuesday-uncommitted-vote-states/72858017007/">Minnesota</a>
that number was almost 19%, in Michigan, 13%. Here in Massachusetts 9.4%
of Democrats voted “Uncommitted” to North Carolina’s 12.7%, Colorado’s
8.1%, and Tennessee’s 7.9%.</p>
<p>Even with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nolabels.org/">No Labels</a> still
trying to recruit a presidential candidate, there are still plenty of
third party challengers: Robert F. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.kennedy24.com/">Kennedy</a> Jr., the Green Party’s
Jill <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jillstein2024.com/">Stein</a>, Cornel <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cornelwest2024.com/">West</a>, a slew of <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Libertarian_Party_presidential_primaries">Libertarians</a>
who will select a candidate at their May convention, Claudia <a
target="_blank" href="https://votesocialist2024.com/about-the-candidates">de la Cruz</a>
of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Joseph <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.socialism2024.org/candidates">Kishore</a> of the
Socialist Equity Party, to name a few.</p>
<p>There is something for almost every political taste — and all taste
better than the featured entrees of a fascist and an accomplice to
genocide.</p>
<p>As both major parties continue to lose faith with the electorate, the
percentage of people voting third party has been steadily increasing. In
2012 1% of the popular vote went to the Libertarians and 0.4% to the
Green Party. In 2016 the Libertarians received 3.28% of the vote and the
Greens 1.07%. In 2024, based on an average of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden-vs-kennedy-vs-west-vs-stein">several
polls</a>, RFK Jr. would receive 12.4% of the vote, Cornel West 2.4%,
and Jill Stein 1.8%.</p>
<p>If you listen to Republicans, America is at a crossroads for white
privilege and white domination; only by reinforcing white Christian
domination can the nation be saved from Marxists, atheists, diversity
programs, and trans children. And if you listen to Democrats, America is
at a crossroads for democratic ideals that have only been available to
<em>some</em> Americans and never to those of the many nations
Democratic presidents have invaded or destroyed.</p>
<p>While I would prefer to not have Project 2025 or Jesus jammed down my
throat during a second Trump presidency, I’m no longer convinced that
Democrats (like their GOP brethren) really care about, or can
convincingly defend, American democracy. I’m also not convinced that
American democracy and freedoms are any more important than
<em>everyone’s</em> right to a democracy or freedom. Joe Biden’s
administration advocates imposing an unelected government on
Palestinians, who will remain under Israel’s yoke, as he continues to
sell weapons to some of the world’s worst human rights abusers,
including Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>If I vote for American democracy and thumb my nose at everyone else’s
— as the Democratic Party chides me I <em>must</em> — how is this any
different from what MAGA Republicans are asking of America? Aren’t we in
this mess because too many politicians have exhibited moral cowardice
and hypocrisy while pursuing political expediency and money? And are we
really obliged to reward them with our votes?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><em>In my next post I’ll look at Project 2025 and Trump’s Agenda
47.</em></p>
