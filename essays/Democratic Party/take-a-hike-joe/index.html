<p>I am one of those voters who cares more about foreign policy than
making Wall Street great again. Don’t try to sell me <em>Bidenomics</em>
when the president hired a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/07/elliott-abrams-war-biden-white-house-bipartisanship/">war
criminal</a>, sent <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/07/politics/cluster-munitions/index.html">cluster
munitions</a> to the Ukraine, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/17/politics/joe-biden-fist-bump-mbs-mohammed-bin-salman-white-house/index.html">fist-bumped</a>
a Saudi prince who had an American journalist hacked into pieces, gave
Indian fascist Narendra Modi a <a
target="_blank" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/22/biden-india-relationship-quad/">bear
hug</a>, gave <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/biden-netanyahu-bear-hug-disaster/">the
same</a> to Israel’s fascist Prime Minister, and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/29/politics/biden-congress-israel-military-aid/index.html">twice
bypassed Congress</a> to provide military aid for Israel’s genocidal
campaign in Gaza.</p>
<p>In case you hadn’t noticed: Donald Trump does not have a monopoly on
presidential depravity.</p>
<p>This week Biden thumbed his nose at that pesky Constitutional
requirement to consult with Congress on US military operations in <a
target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2024/01/11/biden-yemen-strikes-congress-constitution/">Yemen</a>,
and he has expanded the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-01-09/if-china-invades-taiwan-it-would-cost-world-economy-10-trillion">military
budget</a> to obscene levels in order to prepare for a war with China
that his own disastrous <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/world/asia/china-us-russia.html">foreign
policy</a> is making much more likely.</p>
<p><img src="budget.png" /> <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2023/warfare-state-how-funding-militarism-compromises-our-welfare/">The
Biden Budget</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Democratic Party has decided that in a nation of 330
million people there is only one old white guy capable of winning the
Presidency. They can’t sell Biden on either charisma or policy, so all
they do is shriek about Trump while furiously waving their
<em>Bidenomics</em> PowerPoints.</p>
<p>Democrats tell us the danger to America is a war-mongering fascist
when <em>their</em> guy is waging wars at an unprecedented pace and
defending fascism abroad. Democrats tell us we need Biden to fight
creeping American religious nationalism even though Biden himself
defends a similar variant and even <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/i-am-zionist-how-joe-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-2023-10-21/">identifies</a>
with it.</p>
<p>With approval ratings in the toilet, Biden is barely acceptable to
mainstream white Democrats. But if you ask 83% of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/arab-american-support-biden-democrats-plummets-over-israel-poll-2023-10-31/">Arab-Americans</a>
who they’re going to vote for, it’s anyone <em>other</em> than Joe
Biden. Similarly, if you ask <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/young-voters-explain-re-bailing-biden-whether-d-come-back-rcna130186">young
voters</a>, 70% disapprove of his support for Israel’s genocidal war.
Biden began his presidency with a generous 86% approval rating from <a
target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-losing-support-people-color/story?id=105272263">Black
voters</a> but today that number has declined by 23%. Likewise Biden’s
numbers among <a
target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-losing-support-people-color/story?id=105272263">Hispanic
voters</a> have shrunk almost 30% from an initial 72% approval rating to
about 42% today.</p>
<p>A <a
target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/548459/independent-party-tied-high-democratic-new-low.aspx">Gallup
poll</a> this week showed that the damage Biden has done to his approval
ratings are not confined to himself. Biden’s losses have translated into
losses for the Democratic Party as a whole:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Democratic identification has now declined by one point in each of
the past three years. These declines, and the new low registered in
2023, are likely tied to President Joe Biden’s unpopularity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not just Biden’s war-mongering that rankles some of us. Leaving
aside Biden’s disgraceful history of racist legislation, fighting
desegregation, and demeaning Anita Hill while greasing Clarence Thomas’s
confirmation to the Supreme Court, Biden’s lukewarm support for
reproductive rights, his refusal to enlarge the Supreme Court, his lack
of concern for the environment (including actual expansion of oil
drilling), the ease with which Biden threw the poor under the bus during
debt ceiling negotiations, and his shameful capitulations to the Far
Right over immigration – all point to a man who, as his age might
suggest, is living in an alternate reality of the 1980’s when Corvettes
ruled the roads and White Men ruled the world.</p>
<p>You can go online and sign a petition to <a
target="_blank" href="https://rootsaction.salsalabs.org/step-aside-joe">Step Aside,
Joe</a> – not that the DNC is ever going to listen to you. The
Democratic Party is a private entity run by partially- or non-elected
leadership. Biden’s name will be the only one on Democratic primary
ballots in Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, and possibly <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/20/williamson-ballot-access-massachusetts-00132727">Massachusetts</a>.
According to an article in POLITICO, Massachusetts Secretary of State
Bill Galvin can simply add a candidate to the ballot as a figure
“recognized by the national media” or may choose not to place them on
the ballot “if their party doesn’t put their name forward.”
<em>Democracy</em>, you say!</p>
<p>Regardless of how much liberal peer pressure and guilt-tripping is
employed to make you assent to the coronation of a candidate complicit
in genocide, you don’t owe Joe Biden or the DNC a thing. If the
Democratic Party wants to win the Presidency in 2024, it needs another
candidate. Plain and simple. But if the DNC sticks with Biden, his
entirely predictable loss will have been completely self-inflicted.</p>
