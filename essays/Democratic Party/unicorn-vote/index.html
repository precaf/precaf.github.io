<p>I realize that some of us are vastly outnumbered by folks who think
that Democrats should move to the right to accommodate the swing voter,
<em>whoever</em> he may be. Many sins emanate from this strange dogma,
not confined to discounting gay, black or women candidates in 2024, a
willingness to soften demands so as to appeal to the swing voter, or a
failure to defend marginalized Americans — as we saw play out during the
budget ceiling negotiations last week.</p>
<p>In fact, most Democrats probably saw last week’s fight as a win for
pragmatism and centrism. But I see their conclusion as a gross
miscalculation.</p>
<p>Rather than being the party of ideas and principles, the Democratic
Party is mainly, as <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Robert-Reich/2016/1120/Opinion-The-Democratic-party-lost-its-soul.-It-s-time-to-win-it-back">Robert
Reich</a> once characterized it, a vast “fund-raising machine” that has
lost its way if not its soul. The comedian <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfDqDB8uzE">Lewis Black</a> once
quipped that the Democratic Party is the party of “no ideas” while
Republicans are the party of “bad ideas.” Black’s joke was only funny
because it was true.</p>
<p>Unlike the GOP, which operates on an uncompromising and visceral
level (and, it must be conceded, very successfully), Democrats operate
like a house thermostat, adjusting a blast of cold here or a jet of hot
air there to maintain some abstract perfect “middle” temperature that
pleases no one. Ask your spouse if you don’t believe me.</p>
<p>A 2019 study by the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/15/facts-about-us-political-independents/">Pew
Research Center</a> actually looked at this mythological being, the
swing voter. It turns out that the 40% of voters who identify as
so-called “independents” are <em>not really</em> all that independent.
13%, in fact, are pretty much reliable Republicans while 17% are fairly
reliable Democrats. This leaves 7% — mostly young and male — who are
politically unmoored.</p>
<p>This should be no great revelation in a polarized political landscape
in which the “middle” has largely eroded. And yet it is an article of
faith of centrist Democrats.</p>
<p>What’s especially significant, however, is that, of these 7% <em>only
a third actually vote</em>, which reduces the actual percentage of
“independents” to about 2.3% of the American electorate. Democrats might
actually appeal to some of these disaffected young voters if they chose
a progressive candidate under 70, but in the last election most of the
Democratic Presidential candidates thought they could appeal to the
unicorn by <a

the social safety net, going weak on <a

or alienating minority voters by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/buttigieg-calls-out-democrats-playing-identity-politics-n1004706">slamming</a>
“identity politics.” Last week the same Democratic centrists alienated
minority voters even further, not to mention the left wing of the
party.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.stevephillips.com/">Steve Phillips</a> is the
author of <em>How We Win the Civil War</em> and <em>Brown is the New
White</em>. In the latter book he argues, and I agree with him, that it
would be a much smarter move to woo reliable Black and Brown <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/does-party-obama-still-not-understand-rise-brown-voters-n505226">voters</a>
and progressives than a mythological creature. The numbers are simply
better.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to lower themselves to GOP standards, Democrats
ought to be doubling-down on issues that distinguish them from
Republicans. And redoubling fierce opposition to the fascist train
barreling down upon us. Instead, while the Democratic Party insists on
poll-testing and calibrating a perfect room temperature, its right wing
will likely flirt with RFK Jr. and then end up voting for a GOP
candidate.</p>
<p>And — let’s not blame them when they do — some percentage of the
Democratic left wing will end up voting for Cornel West out of disgust —
a disgust borne out of the Democratic Party’s limp and vacillating
policies and neglect. And because West will raise many of the festering
issues that Democrats are simply too frightened to deal with.</p>
