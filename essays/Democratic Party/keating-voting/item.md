I've done a little preliminary research on Bill Keating's voting record in preparation for his [Town Hall](https://www.meetup.com/resist-new-bedford/events/241601873/) at Dartmouth High School on August 30th.

### Not progressive

[Progressive organizations](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/s4p?source=ORem170718) are urging support for eight bills:

-   Medicare for All: [H.R. 676](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676) Medicare For All Act

-   Free College Tuition: [H.R. 1880](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1880) College for All Act of 2017

-   Worker Rights: [H.R.15](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/15) - Raise the Wage Act

-   Women's Rights: [H.R.771](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/771) - Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act of 2017

-   Voting Rights: [H.R. 2840](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2840) - Automatic Voter Registration Act

-   Environmental Justice: Climate Change Bill - Renewable Energy

-   Criminal Justice and Immigrant Rights: [H.R.3543](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3543) - Justice is Not For Sale Act of 2017

-   Taxing Wall Street: [H.R. 1144](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1144/) - Inclusive Prosperity Act

Bill Keating has not co-sponsored *any* of them.

### Consumer

Keating voted YEA with Blue Dog Democrats on [H.R. 3192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3192), a Republican bill which reduces transparency for mortgage lending institutions.

Keating also voted YEA with conservative Democrats on [H.R. 1737](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1737), a Republican bill which neutered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's oversight of Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

### Immigration

Keating is a [hard-liner](http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_Immigration.htm) on [immigration](http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_AE.htm).

Keating and five other Democrats voted for [H.R. 3009](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3009/), the "Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act," a Republican bill to withhold funding for states and municipalities with "sanctuary" policies.

Keating and Blue Dog Democrats voted for [H.R. 4038](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038), the "American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015." The Republican bill adds [additional obstacles](http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20151125/NEWS/151129627) to the already-onerous screening and vetting of Syrian refugees.

Keating voted YEA on [H.R. 3004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3004/), "Kate's Law," a Republican bill which expands indefinite detention of migrants who repeatedly cross the border. The bill will do nothing to prevent future actions by desperate people but it will increase the number of private prisons in the United States.

### Civil Liberties

Keating gets [good grades](http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_Civil_Rights.htm) on civil liberties for women's and LGBTQ issues. However, when it comes to surveillance and Fourth Amendment issues, Keating is no friend and he gets only [middling ones](https://warrantless.org/2016/09/how-massachusetts-congressmembers-stack-up-on-mass-surveillance/): "Keating supported 'cybersecurity' legislation, and opposed defunding the government's Section 702 surveillance programs (PRISM and Upstream); however, he supports banning [backdoor searches](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5293/all-info) on US persons. He voted for the USA FREEDOM Act, which purportedly reformed the small amount of government surveillance that occurs under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, and continued to support it even after its reforms were watered down to the point where there was much debate about whether it would do more harm than good to pass it." Keating also refused to let [PATRIOT Act extensions](https://ssl.capwiz.com/aclu/issues/votes/?votenum=376&chamber=H&congress=1121) expire under "sunset" provisions, including [this](https://ssl.capwiz.com/aclu/issues/votes/?votenum=66&chamber=H&congress=1121) and [this](https://ssl.capwiz.com/aclu/issues/votes/?votenum=36&chamber=H&congress=1121) one.

### Militarism and Foreign Policy

Keating voted NAY on a resolution to bar President Obama from using an AUMF to invade Libya. The resolution would have required Congress to declare war â€” per the U.S. Constitution. Keating did, however, vote YEA on ending the war in Afghanistan.

Keating was [reluctant](http://news.wgbh.org/post/bill-keating-still-mulling-over-iran-deal) to support Obama's and Kerry's Iran deal and has [courted the MEK](https://irana60.wordpress.com/2017/06/23/u-s-congress-sponsors-resolution-seeking-justice-for-mek-members-massacred-by-iran-regime-in-1988/), an exile group which until 2012 was designated a [terrorist organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran) seeking to overthrow and replace the Iranian government with its own "government-in-exile." Thanks to Republican and Democratic hawks the designation was lifted.

Keating is [pro-Likud](http://issues2000.org/MA/Bill_Keating_Foreign_Policy.htm). He has fought international efforts to support a Two State Solution, advocated moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, opposed the use of the word "Palestine" and threatened to cut off U.S. contributions to the U.N. and funding for U.N. refugee efforts because of the international body's criticism of Israel's land theft and occupation.

Keating, along with Democratic hawks, sent a [letter to Rex Tillerson](https://web.archive.org/web/20180923211706/https://poe.house.gov/_cache/files/8/8/88541729-4e95-4d24-8eb7-07d40be618d1/CC9D59BA90C4706C9E436A24A229BE42.06.12.17-tnt-nato-art-5-letter.pdf) affirming their support for Trump's policies on NATO and for Tillerson's office. Keating shares Republicans' view that [NATO](http://www.wickedlocal.com/news/20170625/us-rep-keating-nation-is-facing-critical-time) needs to be stronger to oppose Russia.

Keating [cheered](http://www.capecod.com/newscenter/congressman-keating-says-strike-against-syria-was-necessary-and-proportional/) Donald Trump's deployment of tomahawk missiles, which were in violation of both AUMF statements and the U.S. Constitution.
