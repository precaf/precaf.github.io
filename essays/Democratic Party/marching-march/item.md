Some of you have already received a similar invitation, so forgive me if it is a duplication.

[Marching Forward](https://www.facebook.com/groups/987388698061779/), affiliated with [Swing Left](https://swingleft.org/) and one of two local [Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/groups-nav) chapters, will be holding its [next meeting](https://www.facebook.com/events/1849298588621229/) in 8 days:

> Thursday March 16, 6:30 - 8:00PM  
> [Dartmouth Grange, 1133 Fisher Road, North Dartmouth MA](https://goo.gl/maps/bhh13VP5WWM2). First floor hall  
> Organizational Meeting and discussion with MA Rep. [Chris Markey](https://malegislature.gov/People/Profile/CMM1)

Space is limited, so please [RSVP](mailto:pagaro@gmail.com?subject=RSVP%20March%2016&body=RSVP%20March%2016) because a maximum number of people are allowed in the building. If the maximum number has been exceeded, we promise to send you minutes of the meeting.

Members of other Indivisible chapters are very welcome but please [RSVP](mailto:pagaro@gmail.com?subject=RSVP%20March%2016&body=RSVP%20March%2016). We are expecting a big turnout.

[Parking is limited](https://goo.gl/maps/bhh13VP5WWM2) at the Grange, and there will be an exercise class in the upstairs room that night. Please plan to park at [Alderbrook Farm](https://goo.gl/maps/NBF8trTmk3q), 1213 Russells Mills Road, or along Fisher Road. At Alderbrook there's plenty of parking. Most convenient to the Grange is the area between Fisher Road and the yellow farm stand building, and in front of the greenhouse. Fisher Road is narrow, pull well off the road if you park along it. We will be "passing the hat" to cover the cost of Grange use, and also a website start up.
