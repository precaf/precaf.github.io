Democrats often complain that Bernie Sanders should either join the Democratic Party or knock off the criticism. I even hear this from people who admire the direction Sanders is trying to move the party.

But they forget that the Democratic Party includes many Senators much less reliable on liberal and progressive issues. In the House the party even winks at a faction known as the Blue Dog Coalition which proudly votes conservative. Call them mavericks or traitors, the Democratic Party never knows whether any of these "wildcards" are going to be assets or liabilities. But it's had a reliable friend in Sanders.

The Senate has 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats, and 2 Independents. Of the 46 Democrats, 8 are conservatives and most are centrists. Though it often invokes the memory of the New Deal, the Civil Rights and Labor movements, and Camelot, this is a party that has put a lot of distance between itself and its most cherished values. The corporate-friendly entity that exists today is little more than a fundraising machine. And Democrats, though the memories are sweet, may never be able to come home.
