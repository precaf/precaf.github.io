<p>There is only one other nation on earth with a budget ceiling.
Denmark’s, unlike ours, is set so high that it has never triggered even
the <em>threat</em> of a government shutdown. By contrast, since 1960
alone the United States has had 78 mini “crises” over a debt ceiling
that is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution but was created in 1917 to
make managing wartime economies easier. And we’ve had no end of wartime
economies.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> in the Constitution is Section 4 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which says unequivocally “the validity of the public debt of
the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for
payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing
insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.”</p>
<p><em>“The validity of the public debt … shall not be questioned.”</em>
This is crystal clear: defaulting on public debts is
<em>unconstitutional</em>. The sky would not fall and the world economy
would not collapse if Republican hardliners had no way of holding
Congress hostage. And yet the budget ceiling has become a semi-annual
occasion for producing political theater and grandstanding.</p>
<p>The “deal” that the Biden administration has apparently negotiated
with Kevin McCarthy, who serves at the pleasure of the GOP’s Freedom
Caucus, is being portrayed as a necessary, pragmatic, “best possible”
deal by the administration. “It could have been worse” is about the only
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/29/white-house-debt-ceiling-deal-00099147">excuse</a>
centrist Democrats can make for this shameful capitulation.</p>
<p>If fiscal responsibility was supposed to be the objective, not much
effort was made to generate revenue by rolling back tax breaks for the
super-rich or reducing debt by paring down the obscene, marbled fat
“defense” budget. The military budget, which together with Homeland
Security provisions is now well over a trillion dollars, historically
accounts for a major portion of the national debt.</p>
<p>The debt ceiling talks ended in a deal that both the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers praised — even as
they called for even <em>more</em> austerity and a second course of
regulatory rollbacks.</p>
<p>Instead, the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) imposes (fiscal
responsibility = austerity) on those not responsible for debt but who
need government help the most. “Responsibility” is only for welfare
mothers, not oligarchs, social media barons, agribusiness, the fossil
fuel industry, or for defense contractors. Besides the cuts, the FRA
places limits on discretionary spending for the next two years — yet
none on military spending.</p>
<p>Over 80 programs, many of them social, are having their funding
rescinded. Funding for the IRS — long in the GOP’s crosshairs — is also
being hit. Pay-Go provisions will hobble government programs, where
budget increases here must now be offset with financial cuts there. The
Congressional Budget Office has prepared a 17-page <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf">summary</a>
of the FRA’s main features. Read it and weep.</p>
<p>FRA hits Brown and Black families the hardest, ending the student
loan payment pause, adding additional work requirements to Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, impacting the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and rolling back environmental
protections for communities of color. NAACP President Derrick Johnson
issued a <a
target="_blank" href="https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-president-and-ceo-derrick-johnson-statement-fiscal-responsibility-act">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Let’s be clear: while the original intent of the debt ceiling was
to solve a practical challenge of paying the nation’s bills during World
War I, it has become a weapon used by conservative extremists to hold
the lives and livelihoods of Black America – and countless others –
hostage. The NAACP calls on Congress and the Administration to end this
practice before it can again be used to inflict more harm on Black
America.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Progressive Democrats are justifiably unhappy with this gutless,
immoral deal.</p>
<p>Among other missed opportunities, President Biden failed to show
enough spine with Speaker McCarthy to stand on the Fourteenth Amendment
and risk / provoke a revolt by the GOP Freedom Caucus, which would have
both highlighted the GOP’s cruelty to voters <em>and</em> divided the
GOP.</p>
<p>As for Biden’s hopes for a second term, his age is already a hard
sell. But now the negotiator-in-chief has shown himself to be a weak and
unreliable defender of America’s most vulnerable citizens. Biden has
also dispelled any notion that he has moved to the left over the last
two years. Whether Progressive Democrats will forgive him for this
capitulation is not yet clear, but the bitter aftertaste of this budget
ceiling negotiation will do him no favors in 2024.</p>
