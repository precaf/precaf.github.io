When they invaded Iraq Republicans turned the country into a failed state ISIS could move right into. But then Democrats repeated the same mistake in Libya and Syria.

Fast forward to 2017. Many Democrats now recognize the mistake. But not William R. Keating, a slow learner who in my humble opinion needs a new job.

After Trump sent 50 Tomahawk missles into Syria on April 6th, the [top five American newspapers](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/04/09/five-top-papers-run-18-opinion-pieces-praising-syria-strikes-zero-are-critical) ran 18 editorials praising the attack. There was not a single criticism. Breitbart's [Charles Krauthammer](http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/04/07/krauthammer-syria-strike-sends-message-sheriff-town-america-back/amp/) rejoiced that there was a new sheriff in town. Defense hawk and former Secretary of State [Hillary Clinton](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/04/06/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-assad/index.html) praised Trump's attack and urged him to take out Assad's airfields. By bombing Syria, [Farid Zakaria](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/04/07/fareed-zakaria-trump-became-president-syria-newday.cnn) said, Donald Trump had finally "become president." MSNBC's [Brian Williams](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/04/07/fareed-zakaria-trump-became-president-syria-newday.cnn) called the missiles flying off to do their lethal work "beautiful."

For the most part [Democrats didn't even bother to question](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-criticism-donald-trump-syria-strike_us_58e80e73e4b00de141039d53) whether it had been the Syrian government that killed the civilians with sarin gas. The Liberal *Atlantic Monthly* ran a piece titled [Why America Should have Hit Assad Four Years Ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/522255/). Meanwhile, [CIA-sponsored rebels are fighting US Army-sponsored rebels](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-cia-pentagon-isis-20160327-story.html) along the Turkish border. What the hell is going on? US involvement in Syria is not merely a fiasco, but a giant bipartisan fiasco demonstrating — once again — that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats can be trusted to execute a coherent American foreign or military policy.

Sending a barrage of missiles into another nation is well beyond dispatching a drone to kill a suspected terrorist (and everyone nearby). This kind of attack is without question an act of war. The [War Powers Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42699.pdf) requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours of initiating "hostilities" and forbids forces from remaining past 60 days. So far we have heard nothing from the President. Tellingly, [three weeks before](https://www.armytimes.com/articles/82nd-airborne-syria-iraq-kuwait-islamic-state) the sarin gas incident, the U.S. beefed up troops intended for Syria, and signalled its intent to stay in Syria, even after ISIS had been defeated.

Here in Massachusetts, where we are fortunate to have sensible Senators, voters still need to pay attention to Liberal hawks. [Elizabeth Warren](http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/04/sen_elizabeth_warren_calls_for_1.html), to her credit, demanded to know what Trump's strategy in Syria was. [Ed Markey](https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/movievideo/markey-sees-syria-becoming-another-iraq/vp-BBzBQfk), to his credit, voiced concern that Syria could become another quagmire.

But our very own 9th Congressional district Representative, **William R. Keating, stands with Trump**. Keating is an Iran hawk and had to have his arm twisted to accept Obama's Iran deal. Keating also voted with the GOP to limit Syrian refugees. No big surprise, then — [Keating applauded the missle launch](http://www.capecod.com/newscenter/congressman-keating-says-strike-against-syria-was-necessary-and-proportional/).

**Keating, especially, needs to hear from voters. But call everyone. If you live near one of the local offices, drop in.**
