[Neoconservatives and pro-Israel](http://www.wsj.com/articles/federation_feature?id=110010139) organizations and ideologues have been calling lately for military action against Iran. [House Democrats](/Zionism/trigger-finger/) with close ties to Israel have also been making the same noises. The [Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations](https://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/wp-content/uploads/conference-of-presidents-iran-rabbinic-statement.doc) has organized a call for rabbis to condemn Iran from the pulpit during the High Holy Days. And now Obama's Defense Secretary is trying to sell war on Iran - to the Arab world.

It sure looks like we're being prepped for another war.

The [Jerusalem Post](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251804515777), in an article titled "Arab world should arm against Iran," quotes US Defense Secretary Robert Gates calling for Arab nations to beef-up their militaries. The article is based on an interview with Al Jazeera's [Abderrahim Foukara](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/200995202939732522.html#threat of iran), which can be viewed below. According to Gates, large weapons purchases are already being negotiated with the United States.

In the interview, Foukara asks Gates about the double-standard of asking Iran to give up nuclear research while never questioning Israel's nuclear program. Gates responds:

> First of all, it's the Iranian leadership that has said it wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Those threats have not been made in the other direction. It is the Iranian government that is in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions with respect to these programmes, so focus needs to be on the country that is feuding the will of the international community and the United Nations.

There's so much wrong in Gates' response that it requires some comment. First, I am still looking for a credible translation of an actual threat by Iran against Israel. Neoconservative and pro-Israel warmongers apparently [found what they were looking for](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2001/011214-text.html) in some flowery Farsi. But in terms of violations of UN resolutions, Israel is the clear winner. Then Gates has the threats backwards. Israel's [war games](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/washington/20iran.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin) last year, this year's demonstrations of Israeli naval force in the Suez Canal, and countless Israeli speculations of the "[best time to bomb](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195546681706)" all convey the impression that, if anyone is about to become an aggressor, it's Israel.

This is a very troubling interview because it demonstrates that the _Obama administration itself_, as much as any lobbyist or group of pro-Israel House Democrats, is also starting the beat the drum of war.

Here's an [excerpt](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/200995202939732522.html) from the interview:

> FOUKARA: The issue of Iran and Israel is obviously rattling a lot of countries in the region, the Israelis, the Gulf states, who are thinking about buying more and more weapons, and indeed there has been some sales authorised by the United States. Some estimates put the weapons packages to the Gulf states and Israel at about $100bn. How much substance is there to that?
>
> GATES: That figure sounds very high to me. But I think there's a central question or a central point here to be made and it has to do both with our friends and allies in the region, our Arab allies, as well as the Iranian nuclear programme, and that is one of the pathways, to get the Iranians to change their approach on the nuclear issue, is to persuade them that moving down that path will actually jeopardise their security, not enhance it.
>
> So the more that our Arab friends and allies can straighten their security capabilities, the more they can strengthen their co-operation, both with each other and with us, I think sends the signal to the Iranians that this path they're on is not going to advance Iranian security but in fact could weaken it.
>
> So that's one of the reasons why I think our relationship with these countries and our security co-operation with them is so important.
>
> FOUKARA: I mentioned $100bn and you said that doesn't sound right to you. What does sound right to you as a figure?
>
> GATES: I honestly don't know.
>
> FOUKARA: But there are a lot of weapons being asked for by the countries in the region?
>
> GATES: We have a very broad foreign military sales programme and obviously with most of our friends and allies out there, but the arrangements that are being negotiated right now, I just honestly don't know the accumulated total.
>
> FOUKARA: You're asking the Iranians to give up their intentions to build nuclear weapons. They are saying they're not building nuclear weapons. On the other hand, a lot of people in the region feel that you know that the Israelis do have nuclear weapons and they say why doesn't the West start with Israel, which is known to possess nuclear weapons rather than with the Iranians, who are suspected of having them. What do you say to that argument?
>
> GATES: First of all, it's the Iranian leadership that has said it wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Those threats have not been made in the other direction. It is the Iranian government that is in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions with respect to these programmes, so focus needs to be on the country that is feuding the will of the international community and the United Nations.
>
> FOUKARA: But you decided that the rhetoric of the Iranians reflects the reality of what's going on in Iran in terms of nuclear weapons. Isn't that a leap of faith?
>
> GATES: Well, we obviously have information in terms of what the Iranians are doing. We also have what the Iranians themselves have said, so we only are taking them at their word.
>
> FOUKARA: So you know for sure that they are working on a nuclear bomb?
>
> GATES: I would not go that far but clearly they have elements of their nuclear programme that are in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.
>
> We want them to adhere to these resolutions and we are willing to acknowledge the right of the Iranian government and the Iranian people to have a peaceful nuclear programme if it is intended for the production of electric power so on. What is central, then, is trying to persuade the Iranians to agree to that and then to verification procedures under the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency].
>
> That gives us confidence that it is indeed a peaceful nuclear programme and not a weaponisation programme.
>
> The truth of the matter is that, if Iran proceeds with a nuclear weapons programme it may well spark and arms race, a real arms race, and potentially a nuclear arms race in the entire region.
>
> So it is in the interest of all countries for Iran to agree to arrangements that allow a peaceful nuclear programme and give the international community confidence that's all they're doing.
>
> FOUKARA: But the Obama administration seems to have a difficult circle to square because on one hand they're saying that they want improved relations with the Muslim world. On the other hand, any pressure on Iran, is seen by people in the Muslim world as an indication the US is not genuine in wanting to improve those relations because many Muslims say Israel has nuclear weapons, and the US is not doing anything about it.
>
> GATES: The focus is on which country is in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. The pressure on Iran is simply to be a good member of the international community.
>
> The neighbours around Iran, our Arab friends and allies, are concerned about what is going on in Iran, and not just the governments.
>
> So the question is how does Iran become a member in good standing of the international community. That's in the interest of everybody.
