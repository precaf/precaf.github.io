<h4 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h4>
<p>Let’s begin with an unpleasant but glaring truth – nobody is going to
easily “flip” Bill Keating’s seat.</p>
<p>As the following political profile shows, William R. (“Bill”) Keating
has solid numbers at the voting booth, and his <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/bill-keating/ideologies">centrist</a>
positions are exactly what voters in Massachusetts’s oldest, whitest,
less-educated, military-friendly Congressional district appear to want.
As a long-time member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Keating is
a major beneficiary of the defense industry’s largesse, but he receives
far greater support from organized labor. It’s not clear how the union
money spigot could be shut off, but this is the thing that would hurt
him the most.</p>
<h4 id="congressional-district-9">Congressional District 9</h4>
<p><a
target="_blank" href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US2509-congressional-district-9-ma/">Massachusetts
Congressional District 9</a> is older and whiter than most of
Massachusetts. The median age is 47.3 (20% higher than both US and MA
averages) but the mean is 60-69. Likewise, 83% of the district is white
(43% higher than the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html">national</a>
average and 13% higher than the <a
target="_blank" href="https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Massachusetts/Race-and-Ethnicity">state</a>
average). CD9 is in fact one of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Massachusetts/Race-and-Ethnicity">whitest</a>
parts of the state. 9.8% of the District is foreign-born, half the rate
in the rest of Massachusetts and two-thirds the rate in the US. 6.4% of
the population of CD9 are veterans, 1.5 times the rest of Massachusetts
and only slightly higher than the national average. 43.3% of the
District has a college degree. This is 20% higher than the national
average but 10% less than the state average.</p>
<h4 id="keatings-background">Keating’s background</h4>
<p>William R. Keating was born in Norwood, Norfolk County, Massachusetts
on September 6, 1952. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/william_keating/412435">Keating</a>
received his B.A. from Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Mass. in1974, an
M.B.A. from Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Mass. in 1982, and his J.D.
from Suffolk University, Boston, Mass. in 1985. After passing the bar
Keating went to work for the law firm Keating &amp; Fishman. Keating was
a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1977-1984,
having been elected at the ripe old age of 24. He has been a career
politican literally his entire adult life.</p>
<p>After Joseph Timility resigned from the state Senate, Keating won his
seat, remaining in the state Senate from 1985-1998. Keating ran on a
tough anti-crime platform. He also joined the Joint Public Safety
Committee, where he wrote a drug sentencing “reform” package which
lowered thresholds for possession “with intent to distribute.” Keating’s
legislation was pilloried for being both unncessarily draconian and
vague. But his voters loved it.</p>
<p>Keating then advanced his political careerism as Norfolk County,
Mass. District Attorney from 1998-2010. Upon taking his oath of office,
a third of the Norfolk DA staff either resigned or was fired. He served
two terms as DA.</p>
<p>In 2011 Keating was elected as a Democrat to U.S. Congress, where he
remains today. He is considered a typical “Massachusetts liberal” and in
the 118th Congress <a
target="_blank" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/">Keating
voted with President Joe Biden</a> 100% of the time. Keating’s 2022
election cost him <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=MA09">$1.36
million</a> and he won <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-massachusetts-us-house-district-9.html">59.2%</a>
of the vote, beating Republican challenger Jesse Brown. Keating enjoys
donor support from not only defense contractors who benefit from his
votes in Congress, but receives support from numerous Massachusetts
unions.</p>
<p>Keating sits on the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSFA">House Committee
on Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSAS">House Committee
on Armed Services</a>, including the Armed Services <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSAS/26">Subcommittee
on Intelligence and Special Operations</a>.</p>
<p>In the current (119th) Congress, Keating has <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412435">sponsored
a number of bills and resolutions</a>, many related to Russia and
Ukraine. <em>See Keating’s full list of sponsored legislation at the end
of this report.</em></p>
<h4 id="foreign-policy">Foreign Policy</h4>
<p>Politically, Keating is liberal on most <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/bill-keating/policies">domestic
issues</a>. However, when it comes to foreign policy, Keating is a
pro-NATO, “anti-terror” war hawk who voted to expand both the Patriot
Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Keating has worked on
providing Ukraine with <a
target="_blank" href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-kean-wilson-keating-lieu-golden-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-urging-immediate-transfer-of-atacms-to-ukraine/">more
weapons</a> and on legislation to <a
target="_blank" href="https://keating.house.gov/policy-work/issues/foreign-affairs">sanction</a>
Russia and Russian parliamentarians. He has lobbied the EU to have Iran
<a
target="_blank" href="https://manning.house.gov/media/press-releases/manning-kean-keating-lead-bipartisan-coalition-urging-eu-designate-irans">classified</a>
as a sponsor of state terror and advocated imposing additional <a
target="_blank" href="https://mccaul.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/mccaul-keating-strengthen-iran-sanctions-to-target-the-qods-force">sanctions</a>
on it. When Donald Trump ordered the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2020/01/03/massachusetts-congressional-delegation-reacts-qassem-soleimani-death">assassination</a>
of Iranian General Qassim Soleimani, Keating told Radio Boston it was
indeed a US “escalation” but no one was going to mourn the death of a
war criminal.</p>
<p>In keeping with Keating’s across-the-aisle militarism and
adventurism, he signed a resolution sponsored by far-right Florida
Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in behalf of the Falun Gong, which
claimed that Chinese political prisoners from the religious community
were having their organs harvested by China. These claims were <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-the-face-of-criticism-china-has-been-cleaning-up-its-organ-transplant-industry/2017/09/14/d689444e-e1a2-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html">debunked</a>
by the Washington Post and denied by lawyers from the Falun Gong
itself.</p>
<p>Keating’s Foreign Policy webpage describes him as a “staunch advocate
of human rights and freedom of expression and press.”</p>
<h4 id="israel-palestine">Israel-Palestine</h4>
<p>After October 7th, Keating <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023-10-17/where-the-mass-congressional-delegation-stands-on-the-crisis-in-israel-and-gaza">condemned</a>
Hamas’s “senseless terrorist attacks” and promised Israel that America
had its back. He pooh-poohed any dissention among Democrats over
President Biden’s immediate military aid, telling the Bostong Globe that
the “vast majority” of Democrats support Joe Biden’s stance on helping
Israel bomb Gaza.</p>
<p>Rep. Keating has never sponsored legislation with the words
“Palestine” or “Palestinian” in it. Only one of his resolutions, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hres872">H.Res.872</a>,
which appears to have been authored by the ADL, refers to contemporary
Israel. Two other co-sponsored bills commemorate the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr1299">Warsaw Ghetto
Uprising</a>, in which Jews built bunkers, smuggled in weapons, and
fought the Nazis who had locked them into a section of Warsaw turned
into a concentration camp. Otherwise Keating is focused on Europe,
particularly Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<h4 id="donors">Donors</h4>
<p>OpenSecrets tracks Congressional donors. Of the thousands of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/address/mydistrict?id=N00031933">donors
to Keating’s campaigns</a> between 2015 and 202, two defense contractors
appear in hi top 20 donors – BAE Systems and Raytheon. Two pro-Israel
lobby groups also show up – JStreet and AIPAC. Both AIPAC and BAE are
tied for fourth place.</p>
<p>It is troubling that so much of Keating’s support comes from
organized labor. However, Keating’s domestic policies are much more
liberal than his foreign policies. Ignoring what goes on in the rest of
the world, organized labor has largely viewed the Democratic Party as a
partner in transactional politics. This philosophy seems to be changing,
but the union movement is still quite conservative overall.</p>

have been used extensively to attack Gaza. One source reported that, by
Nov. 25, one Israeli brigade fired some 10,000 such shells using BAE’s
M109 howitzer. 155mm shells<a

is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/19/us-israel-artillery-shells-ukraine-weapons-gaza">planning</a>
to send “tens of thousands of 155mm artillery shells that had been
destined for Ukraine” to Israel. Their use by Israel, <a
target="_blank" href="https://webassets.oxfamamerica.org/media/documents/Artillery_Shells_Transver_Policy_BriefingNote_1.pdf">according
to Oxfam</a>, is “virtually assured to be indiscriminate, unlawful, and
devastating to civilians in Gaza.” On Nov. 13, more than 30
organizations <a
target="_blank" href="https://pomed.org/publication/joint-letter-to-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-austin-opposing-155mm-artillery-shell-transfer-to-israel/">issued</a>
a letter opposing the transfer. General Dynamics also <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gd-ots.com/flyer-72-tactical-utility-vehicle-tuv/">partnered</a>
with Flyer Defense (see above) to develop an armored patrol vehicle that
Israel is testing. On an Oct. 25 call with investors, General Dynamics
CFO, Jason Aiken, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/30/wall-street-morgan-stanley-td-bank-ukraine-israel-hamas-war">said</a>,
“I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of
[the attacks on Gaza], the biggest one to highlight and that really
sticks out is probably on the artillery side.” General Dynamics is based
outside of Washington, D.C., in Fairfax, Virginia. For more locations,

C-130-J Super Hercules aircraft to drop approximately seven tons of
equipment to Israeli soldiers engaging in ground attacks in Khan Younis,
located in the southern Gaza Strip. This was the “first operational

Nov. 9, an Israeli missile hit journalists sitting near Shifa Hospital

Lockheed Martin–made Hellfire R9X missile, a version of the Hellfire
that was developed by the CIA for carrying out assassinations. Instead
of exploding, the missile shreds its target using blades, allowing for a
direct hit without collateral damage. The target in this case was not a
military one. The Israeli military also uses Lockheed Martin’s M270

<p>Like Keating’s donations from unions, he has received money from the
Human Rights Campaign PAC, a group with an LGBTQ+ focus, and NARAL PAC,
which has a reproductive rights focus. And like the Democratic Party,
the center of gravity for both unions and liberal causes, many
progressive organizations apparently can’t see beyond the borders of the

Keating has received a total of $26,395 from pro-Israel lobbies (mainly
AIPAC and JStreet) since entering Congress. For context, the average of
1404 (past and present Congressional) lifetime Israel lobby donations is
a shocking $93,450. On average, Massachusetts Congresspeople received
average lifetime totals of $51,740.</p>
<p>As things go, Keating is hardly the worst offender. The suprise in
the numbers is now-Senator Ed Markey. As a Representative he received
considerable money from AIPAC.</p>

<h4 id="organized-labor">Organized Labor</h4>
<p>In terms of the scope of Keating’s donations from unions, our members
should really study the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00479063&amp;line_number=F3-11C">FEC
database</a>. <strong>If Keating has one obvious vulnerability it is the
uncritical support he receives from organized labor.</strong></p>
<h4 id="keatings-personal-investments">Keating’s Personal
Investments</h4>
<p>In October 2023 RAWStory investigators Dave Levinthal and Alexandria
Jacobson published an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/stock-act-congress-william-keating/">article</a>,
“Busted: Dem lawmaker with military oversight is playing the market with
a military supplier.” The Democratic lawmaker was William F. Keating and
the defense contractor was Boeing.</p>
<p>In a House financial <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24016401-rep-bill-keating-financial-disclosure">disclosure</a>
filed the previous month, Keating reported he had purchased up to
$50,000 of stocks in Boeing and $848.75 in Caterpillar. Boeing
manufactures the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.military.com/equipment/joint-direct-attack-munition-jdam">JDAMs</a>)
that have been used extensively in Gaza, while Caterpillar notoriously
and in flagrant <a
target="_blank" href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/get-involved/tools-resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/factsheet-home-demolitions-and-caterpillar">violation</a>
of international law provides demolition equipment used to destroy
Palestinian homes and infrastructure. Readers may recall that Rachel
Corrie was a US activist who was crushed to death by a militarized
Caterpillar D9 bulldozer in 2003 when she attempted to block the
destruction of a Palestinian home with people still inside it.</p>
<p>When asked about Keating’s investments, a spokesperson said that they
“do not influence the congressman’s policy positions.” But Jessica
Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The
George Washington University, described Keating’s investments as a
“raging conflict of interest.”</p>
