### Political Profile of Rep. William R. Keating

![](greyscale.jpg)

#### The Big Picture

Let's begin with an unpleasant but glaring truth – nobody is going to easily "flip" Bill Keating's seat. 

As the following political profile shows, William R. ("Bill") Keating has solid numbers at the voting booth, and his [centrist](https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/bill-keating/ideologies) positions are exactly what voters in Massachusetts's oldest, whitest, less-educated, military-friendly Congressional district appear to want. As a long-time member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Keating is a major beneficiary of the defense industry's largesse, but he receives far greater support from organized labor. It's not clear how the union money spigot could be shut off, but this is the thing that would hurt him the most.

#### Congressional District 9

[Massachusetts Congressional District 9](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US2509-congressional-district-9-ma/) is older and whiter than most of Massachusetts. The median age is 47.3 (20% higher than both US and MA averages) but the mean is 60-69. Likewise, 83% of the district is white (43% higher than the [national](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html) average and 13% higher than the [state](https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Massachusetts/Race-and-Ethnicity) average). CD9 is in fact one of the [whitest](https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Massachusetts/Race-and-Ethnicity) parts of the state. 9.8% of the District is foreign-born, half the rate in the rest of Massachusetts and two-thirds the rate in the US. 6.4% of the population of CD9 are veterans, 1.5 times the rest of Massachusetts and only slightly higher than the national average. 43.3% of the District has a college degree. This is 20% higher than the national average but 10% less than the state average.

#### Keating's background

William R. Keating was born in Norwood, Norfolk County, Massachusetts on September 6, 1952. [Keating](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/william_keating/412435) received his B.A. from Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Mass. in 1974, an M.B.A. from Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Mass. in 1982, and his J.D. from Suffolk University, Boston, Mass. in 1985. After passing the bar Keating went to work for the law firm Keating & Fishman. Keating was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1977-1984, having been elected at the ripe old age of 24. He has been a career politican literally his entire adult life.

After Joseph Timility resigned from the state Senate, Keating won his seat, remaining in the state Senate from 1985-1998. Keating ran on a tough anti-crime platform. He also joined the Joint Public Safety Committee, where he wrote a drug sentencing "reform" package which lowered thresholds for possession "with intent to distribute." Keating's legislation was pilloried for being both unncessarily draconian and vague. But his voters loved it.

Keating then advanced his political careerism as Norfolk County, Mass. District Attorney from 1998-2010. Upon taking his oath of office, a third of the Norfolk DA staff either resigned or was fired. He served two terms as DA.

In 2011 Keating was elected as a Democrat to U.S. Congress, where he remains today. He is considered a typical "Massachusetts liberal" and in the 118th Congress [Keating voted with President Joe Biden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/) 100% of the time. Keating's 2022 election cost him [$1.36 million](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&id=MA09) and he won [59.2%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-massachusetts-us-house-district-9.html) of the vote, beating Republican challenger Jesse Brown. Keating enjoys donor support from not only defense contractors who benefit from his votes in Congress, but receives support from numerous Massachusetts unions.

Keating sits on the [House Committee on Foreign Affairs](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSFA) and the [House Committee on Armed Services](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSAS), including the Armed Services [Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSAS/26).

In the current (119th) Congress, Keating has [sponsored a number of bills and resolutions](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412435), many related to Russia and Ukraine. *See Keating's full list of sponsored legislation at the end of this report.*

#### Democracy and Transparency

- Despite the tremendous amount of money now being spent on elections at all levels and ballot questions in 2012 and 2014 which showed over 70% of Massachusetts voters supporting a Constitutional amendment to restrict rights to natural persons and to take money out of elections, Keating was not a co-sponsor of [H.J.Res.48](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/48/text), which would have addressed "Citizens United."
- Other members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation — JIm McGovern and even Seth Moulton — co-signed Representatives Bill Pascrell and Debbie Dingell’s letter urging the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to ensure that the NAFTA renegotiation process remains open and transparent. Bill Keating did not.

#### Health Care

- One hundred and sixteen Democrats co-sponsored [H.R.676](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676), John Conyers' Medicare for All Act. Keating was not one of them.
- Keating has not endorsed any other public healthcare option.

#### Worker's Rights

- Keating did not support Worker Rights: [H.R.15](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/15) – Raise the Wage Act.

#### Women's Rights

- The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act of 2017, [H.R.771](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/771), sought to defend a woman's right to choose. Keating did not support it.
- Former DNC chair Tom Perez and former DCCC chair Ray Lujan, as well as some in the New Democrat Coalition, of which Keating and Seth Moulton are members, argue for "flexibility" on abortion and against abortion as a litmus test.

#### Education

- Twenty-seven Democrats co-sponsored [H.R.1880](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1880), the College for All Act. Keating was not one of them.

#### Taxation

- The Inclusive Prosperity Act, [H.R. 1144](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1144/), a Wall Street Speculation fee, is a fraction of a percent tax on stocks, bonds, and financial derivatives that can be used to fund public university tuition and would be offset by tax credits. Keating did not support this.

#### Consumer

- Keating voted YEA with Blue Dog Democrats on [H.R. 3192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3192), a Republican bill which reduces transparency for mortgage lending institutions. This bill was a hit with the American Bankers Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Home Builders lobby, but it prohibited consumers from suing mortgage lenders who violated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosure requirements under the Truth in Lending Act. Keating doesn't believe in amnesty for immigrants. Why then an amnesty for mortgage lenders?
- Keating also voted YEA with conservative Democrats on [H.R. 1737](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1737), a Republican bill which neutered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s oversight of Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Keating and a minority of House Democrats broke with his own party to vote for Republican sponsored H.R.1737, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act. This bill prohibited consumers -- particularly minorities -- from suing auto lenders who violated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules against discrimination in lending. The bill takes the unusual step of preventing disclosures of violations with Freedom of Information Act requests. The NAACP, the Urban League, La Raza, the Consumers Union, and many others, were opposed.

#### Immigration

- Keating is a [hard-liner](http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_Immigration.htm) on [immigration](http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_AE.htm). From "On the Issues": "Bill Keating opposes amnesty. As a District Attorney, Bill Keating enforces our laws and believes that everyone must obey them. His office has prosecuted thousands of criminal cases that resulted in defendants being detained for immigration and deportation action. Bill believes that we must secure our borders, and wants to punish and stop corporations that hire workers here illegally. Bill does not support giving people who are here illegally access to state and federal benefits."
- Keating and five other Democrats voted for [H.R. 3009](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3009/), the “Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act,” a Republican bill to withhold funding for states and municipalities with “sanctuary” policies. 
- Keating and Blue Dog Democrats voted for [H.R. 4038](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038), the “American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015.” The Republican bill added additional obstacles to the already-onerous screening and vetting of Syrian refugees.
- Keating voted YEA on [H.R. 3004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3004/), “Kate’s Law,” a Republican bill which expands indefinite detention of migrants who repeatedly cross the border. The bill will do nothing to prevent future actions by desperate people but it will increase the number of private prisons in the United States.
- During the January Shutdown, only Keating and Stephen Lynch voted for a [stopgap spending bill](http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/01/22/markey-warren-vote-funding-bill) that kept the military happy but threw Dreamers under the bus. The other seven Massachusetts congressman and both U.S. senators voted against it.

#### Civil Liberties

- Keating is no friend of the Fourth Amendment and gets only [middling ratings](https://warrantless.org/2016/09/how-massachusetts-congressmembers-stack-up-on-mass-surveillance/): “Keating supported ‘cybersecurity’ legislation, and opposed defunding the government’s Section 702 surveillance programs (PRISM and Upstream); however, he supports banning [backdoor searches](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5293/all-info) on US persons. 
- Keating voted for the USA FREEDOM Act, which reformed the small amount of government surveillance that occurs under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, and continued to support it even after its reforms were watered down to the point where there was much debate about whether it would do more harm than good to pass it.” 
- Voted for extending FISA in 2018 - [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h16](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h16)

#### Private Prisons

- The Justice is Not for Sale Act, [H.R.3227](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3543), places restrictions on private prisons. At a time Republicans are trying to re-institute discredited justice and prison practices, and pushing privatization, including prisons, schools, and even the war in Afghanistan, Keating did not support this.

#### Voting Rights

- The Automatic Voter Registration Act, [H.R. 2840](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2840), would make voter registration easier and automatic. Keating did not support this.

#### Foreign Policy

Politically, Keating is liberal on some [domestic issues](https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/bill-keating/policies). However, when it comes to foreign policy, Keating is a pro-NATO, "anti-terror" war hawk who voted to expand both the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Keating has worked on providing Ukraine with [more weapons](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-kean-wilson-keating-lieu-golden-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-urging-immediate-transfer-of-atacms-to-ukraine/) and on legislation to [sanction](https://keating.house.gov/policy-work/issues/foreign-affairs) Russia and Russian parliamentarians. He has lobbied the EU to have Iran [classified](https://manning.house.gov/media/press-releases/manning-kean-keating-lead-bipartisan-coalition-urging-eu-designate-irans) as a sponsor of state terror and advocated imposing additional [sanctions](https://mccaul.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/mccaul-keating-strengthen-iran-sanctions-to-target-the-qods-force) on it. When Donald Trump ordered the [assassination](https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2020/01/03/massachusetts-congressional-delegation-reacts-qassem-soleimani-death) of Iranian General Qassim Soleimani, Keating told Radio Boston it was indeed a US "escalation" but no one was going to mourn the death of a war criminal.

In keeping with Keating's across-the-aisle militarism and adventurism, he signed a resolution sponsored by far-right Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in behalf of the Falun Gong, which claimed that Chinese political prisoners from the religious community were having their organs harvested by China. These claims were [debunked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-the-face-of-criticism-china-has-been-cleaning-up-its-organ-transplant-industry/2017/09/14/d689444e-e1a2-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html) by the Washington Post and denied by lawyers from the Falun Gong itself. 

Keating's Foreign Policy webpage describes him as a "staunch advocate of human rights and freedom of expression and press."

#### Militarism and Foreign Policy

- Keating voted NAY on a resolution to bar President Obama from using an AUMF to invade Libya. The resolution would have required Congress to declare war — per the U.S. Constitution. Keating did, however, vote YEA on ending the war in Afghanistan.
- Keating was reluctant to support Obama’s and Kerry’s Iran deal (though he was [critical](https://wsar.com/wsar-news/328252) of Trump for backing out of it) and has [courted the MEK](https://irana60.wordpress.com/2017/06/23/u-s-congress-sponsors-resolution-seeking-justice-for-mek-members-massacred-by-iran-regime-in-1988/), an exile group which until 2012 was designated a [terrorist organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran) seeking to overthrow and replace the Iranian government with its own “government-in-exile.” Republican and Democratic hawks managed to lift the designation.
- Keating is [pro-Israel](https://www.mvtimes.com/2023/10/17/political-local-leaders-support-israel-chabad/). He has fought international efforts to support a Two State Solution, advocated moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, opposed the use of the word “Palestine” and threatened to cut off U.S. contributions to the U.N. and funding for U.N. refugee efforts because of the international body’s criticism of Israel’s land theft and occupation.
- Keating, along with Democratic hawks, sent a [letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223233432/http://poe.house.gov/_cache/files/8/8/88541729-4e95-4d24-8eb7-07d40be618d1/CC9D59BA90C4706C9E436A24A229BE42.06.12.17-tnt-nato-art-5-letter.pdf) to Rex Tillerson affirming their support for Trump’s policies on NATO and for Tillerson’s office. Keating shares Republicans’ view that NATO needs to be stronger to oppose Russia and joined Democratic war hawks in passing [legislation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/16/congress-nato-exit-trump/) to prevent a US President from leaving NATO.

#### Bombing

When President Donald Trump sent 50 Tomahawk missles into Syria on April 6th, 2017, the [top five American newspapers](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/04/09/five-top-papers-run-18-opinion-pieces-praising-syria-strikes-zero-are-critical) ran 18 editorials praising the attack. There was not a single criticism. Sending a barrage of missiles into another nation is without question an act of war. The [War Powers Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42699.pdf) requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours of initiating "hostilities." Defense hawk and former Secretary of State [Hillary Clinton](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/04/06/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-assad/index.html) praised Trump's attack and urged him to take out Assad's airfields. 

By bombing Syria, CNN's [Farid Zakaria](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/04/07/fareed-zakaria-trump-became-president-syria-newday.cnn) said, Donald Trump had finally "become president." MSNBC's [Brian Williams](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/04/07/fareed-zakaria-trump-became-president-syria-newday.cnn) called the missiles flying off to do their lethal work "beautiful." For the most part [Democrats didn't even bother to question](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-criticism-donald-trump-syria-strike_us_58e80e73e4b00de141039d53) whether the Syrian government deserved the attack. The Liberal *Atlantic Monthly* ran a piece titled [Why America Should have Hit Assad Four Years Ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/522255/). Keating hopped on the militarist bandwagon, [cheering](http://www.capecod.com/newscenter/congressman-keating-says-strike-against-syria-was-necessary-and-proportional/) Trump’s deployment of the Raytheon tomahawk missiles, which was in violation of both the AUMF and the U.S. Constitution.

#### Israel-Palestine

After October 7th, Keating [condemned](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023-10-17/where-the-mass-congressional-delegation-stands-on-the-crisis-in-israel-and-gaza) Hamas's "senseless terrorist attacks" and promised Israel that America had its back. He pooh-poohed any dissention among Democrats over President Biden's immediate military aid, telling the Boston Globe that the "vast majority" of Democrats support Joe Biden's stance on helping Israel bomb Gaza.

Rep. Keating has rarely sponsored legislation with the words "Palestine" or "Palestinian" in it. Only one of his resolutions, [H.Res.872](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hres872), which appears to have been authored by the ADL, refers to contemporary Israel. Two other co-sponsored bills commemorate the [Warsaw Ghetto Uprising](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr1299), in which Jews built bunkers, smuggled in weapons, and fought the Nazis who had locked them into a section of Warsaw turned into a concentration camp. Otherwise Keating is focused on Europe, particularly Russia and Ukraine.

#### Donors

Much of Keating's support comes from organized labor since his domestic policies are much more liberal than his foreign policies. However, ignoring what goes on in the rest of the world, organized labor views the Democratic Party as a partner in transactional politics. This philosophy may be changing, but the union movement is still quite conservative overall.

OpenSecrets tracks Congressional donors. Of the thousands of [donors to Keating's campaigns](https://www.opensecrets.org/address/mydistrict?id=N00031933) between 2015 and 202, two defense contractors appear in hi top 20 donors – BAE Systems and Raytheon. Two pro-Israel lobby groups also show up – JStreet and AIPAC. Both AIPAC and BAE are tied for fourth place, along with a number of unions.

According to the [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&committee_id=C00479063&line_number=F3-11C), which tracks the details of each donation, Keating took money from defense contractors BAE, Boeing, General Dynamics, General Electric, L3 Harris, Lockheed-Martin, Northrop Grumman, OSI Systems, and RTX/Raytheon. This the total haul from these defense contractors and also the Israel Lobby:

| **Donor**        | **Amount** |
| ---------------- | ---------: |
| AIPAC            |    $22,900 |
| JStreet          |     $4,000 |
| BAE              |   $100,500 |

| Northrop Grumman |   $178,000 |
| OSI Systems      |     $2,000 |
| RTX / Raytheon   |   $178,000 |
| **TOTAL**        |   $969,400 |

The American Friends Service Committee' [Investigate](https://investigate.info/all-companies) project has researched the role of each in either the [carpet bombing of Gaza](https://afsc.org/companies-2023-attack-gaza) or corporate [complicity](https://investigate.info/all-companies) in Israel's occupation and Apartheid system.

Some of these shells are [white phosphorus bombs](https://citizenevidence.org/2023/10/13/israel-opt-identifying-the-israeli-armys-use-of-white-phosphorus-in-gaza/), the use of which is [forbidden](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/12/israel-white-phosphorus-used-gaza-lebanon) in densely populated civilian areas and potentially amounts to a war crime.

Boeing also manufactures multiple types of unguided small diameter bombs (SDBs) and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits, which convert these bombs into precision-guided munitions. Israel has been using these bombs extensively, including in a [Nov. 1 bombing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/jabalia-camp-airstrike-gaza) of Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, which killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and [could amount to a war crime](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/2/un-rights-office-says-israeli-attacks-on-jabalia-could-be-war-crime), according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. On Oct. 10 and 22, the Israeli military used bombs equipped with Boeing JDAM kits to carry out what [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/12/israel-opt-us-made-munitions-killed-43-civilians-in-two-documented-israeli-air-strikes-in-gaza-new-investigation/) calls "unlawful air strikes on homes full of civilians in the occupied Gaza Strip." The attacks, which could amount to a war crime, killed 24 people of the al-Najjar family and 19 people of the Abu Mu'eileq family. Immediately after Oct. 7, Boeing [expedited](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-10/boeing-sped-1-000-smart-bombs-to-israel-after-the-hamas-attacks) delivery of 1,000 smart bombs, and [another](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-18/boeing-accelerates-delivery-of-up-to-1-800-gps-guidance-bomb-kits-to-israel?embedded-checkout=true) 1,800 JDAM kits, to Israel. Both deliveries were part of a 2021 order that Israel made during its previous large-scale attack on Gaza.

| [General Dynamics](https://investigate.info/company/general-dynamics) | The world's sixth largest weapons manufacturer, [General Dynamics](https://investigate.afsc.org/company/general-dynamics), supplies Israel with artillery ammunition and bombs for attack jets used in Israel’s assault on Gaza. The company developed the F-16 fighter jet, although it has been manufactured by Lockheed Martin since 1993. General Dynamics is the [only company](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2023/11/09/htsr-n09.html) in the U.S. that makes the metal bodies of the MK-80 bomb series, the primary weapon type Israel uses to bomb Gaza. The bodies of the bombs are filled with explosives by the U.S. military, and then can be made into a guided bomb using [Boeing](https://investigate.info/company/boeing)'s JDAM kits. It is also the [only company](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/long-war-in-ukraine-highlights-need-for-u-s-army-to-modernize-ammo-production) in the U.S. that makes 155mm caliber artillery shells, which have been used extensively to attack Gaza. One source reported that, by Nov. 25, one Israeli brigade fired some 10,000 such shells using BAE’s M109 howitzer. 155mm shells[ have been part](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3563298/dod-responds-to-attacks-continues-efforts-to-deter-spread-of-israel-hamas-war/) of the U.S.’s recent weapons shipments to Israel. The U.S. is [planning](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/19/us-israel-artillery-shells-ukraine-weapons-gaza) to send “tens of thousands of 155mm artillery shells that had been destined for Ukraine” to Israel. Their use by Israel, [according to Oxfam](https://webassets.oxfamamerica.org/media/documents/Artillery_Shells_Transver_Policy_BriefingNote_1.pdf), is “virtually assured to be indiscriminate, unlawful, and devastating to civilians in Gaza.” On Nov. 13, more than 30 organizations [issued](https://pomed.org/publication/joint-letter-to-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-austin-opposing-155mm-artillery-shell-transfer-to-israel/) a letter opposing the transfer. General Dynamics also [partnered](https://www.gd-ots.com/flyer-72-tactical-utility-vehicle-tuv/) with Flyer Defense (see above) to develop an armored patrol vehicle that Israel is testing. On an Oct. 25 call with investors, General Dynamics CFO, Jason Aiken, [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/30/wall-street-morgan-stanley-td-bank-ukraine-israel-hamas-war), “I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of [the attacks on Gaza], the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side.” General Dynamics is based outside of Washington, D.C., in Fairfax, Virginia.

Israel also uses the company’s C-130 Hercules transport planes to support the ground invasion of Gaza. Lockheed Martin manufactures AGM-114 Hellfire missiles for Israel’s Apache helicopters. One of the main weapon types used in aerial attacks on Gaza, these missiles have been used extensively in 2023. Some 2,000 Hellfire missiles were [delivered](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/pentagon-is-quietly-sending-israel-ammunition-laser-guided-missiles?embedded-checkout=true) to Israel sometime between Oct. 7 and Nov. 14.

On Dec. 11, the Israeli Air Force [used](https://israeldefense.co.il/node/60572) a Lockheed Martin C-130-J Super Hercules aircraft to drop approximately seven tons of equipment to Israeli soldiers engaging in ground attacks in Khan Younis, located in the southern Gaza Strip. This was the "first operational airdrop" that Israel has carried out since the 2006 Lebanon War. On Nov. 9, an Israeli missile hit journalists sitting near Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The missile was [reportedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zJTz52X9lg) a Lockheed Martin–made Hellfire R9X missile, a version of the Hellfire that was developed by the CIA for carrying out assassinations. Instead of exploding, the missile shreds its target using blades, allowing for a direct hit without collateral damage. The target in this case was not a military one. The Israeli military also uses Lockheed Martin’s M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Used to fire [Elbit Systems](https://investigate.info/company/elbit-systems)’ high-precision AccuLAR-122, the weapon was used by Israel for the [first time](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-multiple-rocket-launcher-used-to-target-hamas-in-gaza-for-first-time-since-2006/), since the 2006 war in Lebanon, on Oct. 6, according to the Israeli military.

Like Keating's donations from unions, he has received money from the Human Rights Campaign PAC, a group with an LGBTQ+ focus, and NARAL PAC, which has a reproductive rights focus. And like the Democratic Party, the center of gravity for both unions and liberal causes, many progressive organizations apparently can't see beyond the borders of the United States.

#### Israel Lobby

According to [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary?code=Q05&cycle=All&ind=Q05&mem=Y&recipdetail=H) Keating has received a total of $26,395 from pro-Israel lobbies (mainly AIPAC and JStreet) since entering Congress. For context, the average of 1404 (past and present Congressional) lifetime Israel lobby donations is a shocking $93,450. On average, Massachusetts Congresspeople received average lifetime totals of $51,740.

As things go, Keating is hardly the worst offender. The suprise in the numbers is now-Senator Ed Markey. As a Representative he received considerable money from AIPAC.

| Average                      |                   $51,740 |

#### Organized Labor

In terms of the scope of Keating's donations from unions, the [FEC database](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&committee_id=C00479063&line_number=F3-11C) is the place to look. If Keating has one obvious vulnerability it is the uncritical support he receives from organized labor.

#### Keating's Personal Investments

In October 2023 RAWStory investigators Dave Levinthal and Alexandria Jacobson published an [article](https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/stock-act-congress-william-keating/), "Busted: Dem lawmaker with military oversight is playing the market with a military supplier." The Democratic lawmaker was William R. Keating and the defense contractor was Boeing.

 In a House financial [disclosure](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24016401-rep-bill-keating-financial-disclosure) filed the previous month, Keating reported he had purchased up to $50,000 of stocks in Boeing and $848.75 in Caterpillar. Boeing manufactures the Joint Direct Attack Munitions ([JDAMs](https://www.military.com/equipment/joint-direct-attack-munition-jdam)) that have been used extensively in Gaza, while Caterpillar notoriously and in flagrant [violation](https://ccrjustice.org/home/get-involved/tools-resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/factsheet-home-demolitions-and-caterpillar) of international law provides demolition equipment used to destroy Palestinian homes and infrastructure. Readers may recall that Rachel Corrie was a US activist who was crushed to death by a militarized Caterpillar D9 bulldozer in 2003 when she attempted to block the destruction of a Palestinian home with people still inside it.

When asked about Keating's investments, a spokesperson said that they "do not influence the congressman's policy positions." But Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University, described Keating’s investments as a “raging conflict of interest.”
