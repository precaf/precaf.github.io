Keating</span></h3><p><img src="greyscale.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 id='the-big-picture'><span>The Big Picture</span></h4><p><span>Let&#39;s begin with an unpleasant but glaring truth – nobody is going to easily &quot;flip&quot; Bill Keating&#39;s seat. </span></p><p><span>As the following political profile shows, William R. (&quot;Bill&quot;) Keating has solid numbers at the voting booth, and his </span><a href='https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/bill-keating/ideologies'><span>centrist</span></a><span> positions are exactly what voters in Massachusetts&#39;s oldest, whitest, less-educated, military-friendly Congressional district appear to want. As a long-time member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Keating is a major beneficiary of the defense industry&#39;s largesse, but he receives far greater support from organized labor. It&#39;s not clear how the union money spigot could be shut off, but this is the thing that would hurt him the most.</span></p><h4 id='congressional-district-9'><span>Congressional District 9</span></h4><p><a href='https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US2509-congressional-district-9-ma/'><span>Massachusetts Congressional District 9</span></a><span> is older and whiter than most of Massachusetts. The median age is 47.3 (20% higher than both US and MA averages) but the mean is 60-69. Likewise, 83% of the district is white (43% higher than the </span><a href='https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html'><span>national</span></a><span> average and 13% higher than the </span><a href='https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Massachusetts/Race-and-Ethnicity'><span>state</span></a><span> average). CD9 is in fact one of the </span><a href='https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Massachusetts/Race-and-Ethnicity'><span>whitest</span></a><span> parts of the state. 9.8% of the District is foreign-born, half the rate in the rest of Massachusetts and two-thirds the rate in the US. 6.4% of the population of CD9 are veterans, 1.5 times the rest of Massachusetts and only slightly higher than the national average. 43.3% of the District has a college degree. This is 20% higher than the national average but 10% less than the state average.</span></p><h4 id='keatings-background'><span>Keating&#39;s background</span></h4><p><span>William R. Keating was born in Norwood, Norfolk County, Massachusetts on September 6, 1952. </span><a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/william_keating/412435'><span>Keating</span></a><span> received his B.A. from Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Mass. in 1974, an M.B.A. from Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Mass. in 1982, and his J.D. from Suffolk University, Boston, Mass. in 1985. After passing the bar Keating went to work for the law firm Keating &amp; Fishman. Keating was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1977-1984, having been elected at the ripe old age of 24. He has been a career politican literally his entire adult life.</span></p><p><span>After Joseph Timility resigned from the state Senate, Keating won his seat, remaining in the state Senate from 1985-1998. Keating ran on a tough anti-crime platform. He also joined the Joint Public Safety Committee, where he wrote a drug sentencing &quot;reform&quot; package which lowered thresholds for possession &quot;with intent to distribute.&quot; Keating&#39;s legislation was pilloried for being both unncessarily draconian and vague. But his voters loved it.</span></p><p><span>Keating then advanced his political careerism as Norfolk County, Mass. District Attorney from 1998-2010. Upon taking his oath of office, a third of the Norfolk DA staff either resigned or was fired. He served two terms as DA.</span></p><p><span>In 2011 Keating was elected as a Democrat to U.S. Congress, where he remains today. He is considered a typical &quot;Massachusetts liberal&quot; and in the 118th Congress </span><a href='https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/'><span>Keating voted with President Joe Biden</span></a><span> 100% of the time. Keating&#39;s 2022 election cost him </span><a href='https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=MA09'><span>$1.36 million</span></a><span> and he won </span><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-massachusetts-us-house-district-9.html'><span>59.2%</span></a><span> of the vote, beating Republican challenger Jesse Brown. Keating enjoys donor support from not only defense contractors who benefit from his votes in Congress, but receives support from numerous Massachusetts unions.</span></p><p><span>Keating sits on the </span><a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSFA'><span>House Committee on Foreign Affairs</span></a><span> and the </span><a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSAS'><span>House Committee on Armed Services</span></a><span>, including the Armed Services </span><a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSAS/26'><span>Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the current (119th) Congress, Keating has </span><a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412435'><span>sponsored a number of bills and resolutions</span></a><span>, many related to Russia and Ukraine. </span><em><span>See Keating&#39;s full list of sponsored legislation at the end of this report.</span></em></p><h4 id='democracy-and-transparency'><span>Democracy and Transparency</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>Despite the tremendous amount of money now being spent on elections at all levels and ballot questions in 2012 and 2014 which showed over 70% of Massachusetts voters supporting a Constitutional amendment to restrict rights to natural persons and to take money out of elections, Keating was not a co-sponsor of </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/48/text'><span>H.J.Res.48</span></a><span>, which would have addressed &quot;Citizens United.&quot;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Other members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation — JIm McGovern and even Seth Moulton — co-signed Representatives Bill Pascrell and Debbie Dingell’s letter urging the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to ensure that the NAFTA renegotiation process remains open and transparent.

Keating was not one of them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keating has not endorsed any other public healthcare option.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='workers-rights'><span>Worker&#39;s Rights</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>Keating did not support Worker Rights: </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/15'><span>H.R.15</span></a><span> – Raise the Wage Act.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='womens-rights'><span>Women&#39;s Rights</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act of 2017, </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/771'><span>H.R.771</span></a><span>, sought to defend a woman&#39;s right to choose. Keating did not support it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Former DNC chair Tom Perez and former DCCC chair Ray Lujan, as well as some in the New Democrat Coalition, of which Keating and Seth Moulton are members, argue for &quot;flexibility&quot; on abortion and against abortion as a litmus test.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='education'><span>Education</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>Twenty-seven Democrats co-sponsored </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1880'><span>H.R.1880</span></a><span>, the College for All Act.

Keating did not support this.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='consumer'><span>Consumer</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>Keating voted YEA with Blue Dog Democrats on </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3192'><span>H.R. 3192</span></a><span>, a Republican bill which reduces transparency for mortgage lending institutions. This bill was a hit with the American Bankers Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Home Builders lobby, but it prohibited consumers from suing mortgage lenders who violated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosure requirements under the Truth in Lending Act. Keating doesn&#39;t believe in amnesty for immigrants. Why then an amnesty for mortgage lenders?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keating also voted YEA with conservative Democrats on </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1737'><span>H.R. 1737</span></a><span>, a Republican bill which neutered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s oversight of Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Keating and a minority of House Democrats broke with his own party to vote for Republican sponsored H.R.1737, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act. This bill prohibited consumers -- particularly minorities -- from suing auto lenders who violated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules against discrimination in lending. The bill takes the unusual step of preventing disclosures of violations with Freedom of Information Act requests. The NAACP, the Urban League, La Raza, the Consumers Union, and many others, were opposed.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='immigration'><span>Immigration</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>Keating is a </span><a href='http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_Immigration.htm'><span>hard-liner</span></a><span> on </span><a href='http://www.ontheissues.org/MA/Bill_Keating_AE.htm'><span>immigration</span></a><span>. From &quot;On the Issues&quot;: &quot;Bill Keating opposes amnesty. As a District Attorney, Bill Keating enforces our laws and believes that everyone must obey them. His office has prosecuted thousands of criminal cases that resulted in defendants being detained for immigration and deportation action. Bill believes that we must secure our borders, and wants to punish and stop corporations that hire workers here illegally. Bill does not support giving people who are here illegally access to state and federal benefits.&quot;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keating and five other Democrats voted for </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3009/'><span>H.R. 3009</span></a><span>, the “Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act,” a Republican bill to withhold funding for states and municipalities with “sanctuary” policies. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Keating and Blue Dog Democrats voted for </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038'><span>H.R. 4038</span></a><span>, the “American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015.” The Republican bill added additional obstacles to the already-onerous screening and vetting of Syrian refugees.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keating voted YEA on </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3004/'><span>H.R. 3004</span></a><span>, “Kate’s Law,” a Republican bill which expands indefinite detention of migrants who repeatedly cross the border. The bill will do nothing to prevent future actions by desperate people but it will increase the number of private prisons in the United States.</span></p></li><li><p><span>During the January Shutdown, only Keating and Stephen Lynch voted for a </span><a href='http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/01/22/markey-warren-vote-funding-bill'><span>stopgap spending bill</span></a><span> that kept the military happy but threw Dreamers under the bus. The other seven Massachusetts congressman and both U.S. senators voted against it.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='civil-liberties'><span>Civil Liberties</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>Keating is no friend of the Fourth Amendment and gets only </span><a href='https://warrantless.org/2016/09/how-massachusetts-congressmembers-stack-up-on-mass-surveillance/'><span>middling ratings</span></a><span>: “Keating supported ‘cybersecurity’ legislation, and opposed defunding the government’s Section 702 surveillance programs (PRISM and Upstream); however, he supports banning </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5293/all-info'><span>backdoor searches</span></a><span> on US persons. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Keating voted for the USA FREEDOM Act, which reformed the small amount of government surveillance that occurs under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, and continued to support it even after its reforms were watered down to the point where there was much debate about whether it would do more harm than good to pass it.” </span></p></li><li><p><span>Voted for extending FISA in 2018 - </span><a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h16'><span>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h16</span></a></p></li></ul><h4 id='private-prisons'><span>Private Prisons</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>The Justice is Not for Sale Act, </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3543'><span>H.R.3227</span></a><span>, places restrictions on private prisons. At a time Republicans are trying to re-institute discredited justice and prison practices, and pushing privatization, including prisons, schools, and even the war in Afghanistan, Keating did not support this.</span></p></li></ul><h4 id='voting-rights'><span>Voting Rights</span></h4><ul><li><p><span>The Automatic Voter Registration Act, </span><a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2840'><span>H.R. 2840</span></a><span>, would make voter registration easier and automatic.

However, when it comes to foreign policy, Keating is a pro-NATO, &quot;anti-terror&quot; war hawk who voted to expand both the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Keating has worked on providing Ukraine with </span><a href='https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-kean-wilson-keating-lieu-golden-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-urging-immediate-transfer-of-atacms-to-ukraine/'><span>more weapons</span></a><span> and on legislation to </span><a href='https://keating.house.gov/policy-work/issues/foreign-affairs'><span>sanction</span></a><span> Russia and Russian parliamentarians.
