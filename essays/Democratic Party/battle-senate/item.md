As the remaining votes in the 2020 presidential election continue to be counted, the math is showing that more than 75 million Americans have had enough of Donald Trump, while 70 million still think he walks with Jesus. Biden's win over a white supremacist does not necessary add up to a mandate, but the almost 5 million difference in votes was a clear victory for Americans who felt they had been brought to the edge of a cliff.

Regardless of Biden's win, he will be severely hobbled if Republicans maintain control of the Senate. The election decided 96 Senate seats — 48 for Republicans, 48 for Democrats — but two Senate seats from Georgia remain to be filled by recount and special election.

The battle for the United States Senate is just getting started.

Two Senate seats remain undecided in the exceptionally close races in Georgia. Besides a presidential vote that is almost certainly headed for recount, in January [Raphael Warnock](https://warnockforgeorgia.com/) will face Republican Kelly Loeffler in a [special election](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/georgia/senate-special/) after a four-way race, and [Jon Ossoff](https://electjon.com/) will face Republican David Perdue in a Senate [runoff](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/georgia/senate/) election.

If both Warnock and Ossoff win their elections, Democrats would have a majority in the Senate.

After Trump's stinging repudiation, and because the Senate hangs in the balance, Republicans are not going to go down in Georgia without a fight. These two Senate races will almost certainly be the most expensive in history. Republicans will pull out all the stops to raise large sums to defeat Warnock and Ossoff. And then they will try to suppress the vote and challenge ballots.

Funding for both candidates, and for voting integrity, will be necessary to win this fight.
