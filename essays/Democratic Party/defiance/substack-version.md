At the national level Democrats may be forgiven for doing little for DACA and TPS recipients or for immigration reform in general. But, in a majority Democratic state like Massachusetts, there is no excuse for the legislature dragging its heels on reasonable immigrant protections called for by the party's own platform. House Speaker Robert DeLeo has repeatedly manipulated and maneuvered to shelve bills and limit votes on immigration, and now he's trying to [strip immigrant protection](https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/07/house_speaker_robert_deleo_sug.html) provisions from the FY2019 budget.

Of course we can't blame it all on DeLeo — who now has exhausted every last cent of his political capital with progressives. House Democrats can't — and shouldn't — hide behind the Speaker forever. Ultimately they will be held to personal account. Too many members of the State House sound like Republicans in their willingness to "go along to get along" with cruel attacks on undocumented families. It's simply hypocrisy for Massachusetts Democrats to chastise Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell for their lack of spine when they themselves are guilty of the same.

Last year I attended the Massachusetts Democratic convention in Worcester, at which a [new party platform](https://massdems.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-Platform-Massachusetts-Democratic-Party.pdf) was drafted. Among the hollow declarations of resistance and highfalutin but ultimately meaningless verbiage added to the platform were planks calling for a living wage and sensible immigration polices.

It was left to groups like RaiseUp to fight to get living wages on the November ballot because Democrats themselves didn't find it important enough. And even though the state party's platform calls for immigrant protections, these proved to be hollow promises as well:

-   "Becoming a sanctuary state, where all immigrants and refugees feel welcome and safe in all communities of the Commonwealth."

-   "Eliminating policies that make local and state officials responsible for the enforcement of national immigration laws."

For many of us the MassDems platform has no value other than to document the hollowness of a party whose real-life politicians have no intention of standing by the party's professed values.

Representatives, start acting like Democrats. Ultimately voters are going to look at your positions and voting record, not Speaker DeLeo's. Do the right thing. Stand up for the principles we voted for last year. Stand up for some of the state's most vulnerable people. Show some backbone. Defy the Speaker. Keep immigration protections in the budget.
