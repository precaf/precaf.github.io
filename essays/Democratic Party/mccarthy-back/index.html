<p>On February 7th, the House Financial Services and Senate Judiciary
committees voted on a resolution:</p>
<p><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/9">H.Con.Res.9
- Denouncing the horrors of socialism</a></p>
<p>The resolution was sponsored by Florida House Republican Maria Elvira
Salazar, the daughter of Cuban exiles who likely knew Cuban military
dictator <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/castro-fulgencio-batista-1901-1973/">Fulgencia
Batista,</a> who fled to Florida about the same time as they. For Cuban
exiles like Salazar’s parents, who lost sweat shops and colonial
plantations to agrarian reforms, socialism was all-too easily conflated
with a Holocaust.</p>
<p>But just to keep things in perspective, and perhaps as one indicator
of just how lopsided wealth in Cuba was <em>before</em>, after the
revolution Castro nationalized his own family’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/castro-town-fidel-grew-up-here-but-he-came-back-to-destroy-it/2016/12/03/51b0f40e-b8d2-11e6-b994-f45a208f7a73_story.html">25,000
acre estate</a>. Plantations like Castro’s family’s were worked by
landless farmers living and working in conditions similar to Southern
plantations and pre-revolutionary Russian estates. For Cuba’s virulent
anti-Communists, plantations and military dictators were the “good old
days.”</p>
<p>Salazar’s resolution conflates socialism with totalitarian regimes,
famine, mass murder, and places Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez and Nicolas
Maduro in the same company as Pol Pot and Joseph Stalin. Salazar’s
resolution is filled with hysterical hyperbole and concludes with a
ridiculous claim found neither in the Declaration of Independence nor
the Constitution: “Whereas the United States of America was founded on
the belief in the <em>sanctity of the individual, to which the
collectivistic system of socialism in all of its forms is fundamentally
and necessarily opposed</em>: Now, therefore, be it resolved…”</p>
<p>None of this is surprising coming from the Republican Party, which
has clearly lost its collective mind and is in fact, and in Florida most
<em>acutely</em> pursuing, the systematic dismantling of the Bill of
Rights.</p>
<p>But most Americans make a distinction between European democratic
socialism and the distorted dictatorships found in North Korea, Russia,
and China. No sane individual believes for a second that “National
Socialism” (aka <em>Nazism</em>) had <em>anything</em> to do with
socialism. A <a
target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357755/socialism-capitalism-ratings-unchanged.aspx">2021
Gallup Poll</a> found that 52% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans view
American Capitalism positively and, <em>rather counter-intuitively</em>,
that 65% of Democrats and 14% of Republicans think of socialism in a
<em>positive</em> light.</p>
<p>For Republicans, who are now the “either-or” heirs of the John Birch
Society, it is <em>either</em> Capitalism <em>or</em> socialism.
Democrats, on the other hand, understand “socialist” in the context of
European social-democratic governments whose support for national
healthcare, heavily subsidized education, housing, and parental leave
contribute to a social safety net Republicans dismiss as “Communism.”
For most Democrats “socialism” means features of social governance that
can conceivably exist alongside a less predatory version of Capitalism.
For Republicans, only the most predatory form of Capitalism is worth
saving.</p>
<p>So it was disappointing to find that 109 Democrats — including <a
target="_blank" href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023106">a majority of the
Massachusetts House delegation</a> — signed on to Salazar’s resolution.
Only Jim McGovern, Richard Neal, and Ayanna Pressley refused to make a
show of red-blooded patriotic anti-Communism. At the very least they
made a distinction that 65% of registered Democrats share regarding the
nature of “socialism.” I was not surprised by Bill Keating, Stephen
Lynch, Seth Moulton, or Jake Auchincloss. I had expected more of Lori
Trahan and Katherine Clark, previously (and significantly) the Assistant
House Democratic Leader.</p>
<p>“Disappointing” doesn’t even begin to describe Massachusetts House
Democrats. Their disgraceful vote was another sign that the Democratic
Party is as ambivalent about the social safety net as it is about every
other liberal issue or democratic right it has already conceded to
Republicans through collusion or neglect. From police reform to the
defense of abortion and voting rights, Democrats allow Republicans to
set the agenda on every issue, and they seem only too happy to join
their Republican colleagues in betraying working people and minorities
as they undermine <em>true</em> liberals within their own party.</p>
<p>With the ascendancy of the Tea Party, Trump, De Santis, and others in
the GOP’s far-right starlight — and with a slim Republicans majority in
the House — it appears we have entered a new <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-McCarthy">McCarthy
era</a>. In the Fifties, the first targets of <em>Joe McCarthy</em> were
liberal Democrats he <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/mccarthy-red-scare">claimed</a>
were “communistically inclined”, along with <a
target="_blank" href="https://forward.com/culture/450247/mccarthy-was-anti-communist-was-he-also-anti-semitic/">Jews</a>,
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/story/how-did-joseph-mccarthys-anticommunist-rhetoric-impact-the-lgbtq-community">gays</a>,
and “Hollywood elites.” McCarthy succeeded in having libraries
throughout the US purged of books, including Philip Foner’s <em>The
Selected Works of Thomas Jefferson</em> and <a
target="_blank" href="https://bookshop.org/a/7256/9781684115976"><em>The Children’s
Hour</em></a> by Lillian Hellman, a play about false accusations in a
girl’s school that had obvious parallels with what McCarthy himself was
doing. If you live in Florida today, no doubt you are experiencing
either <em>deja vu</em> or PTSD.</p>
<p>I have long believed that the Democratic Party, <em>sadly</em>, is
the only thing standing between Republicans and the final nail in the
coffin of American democracy. But if Democrats are not up to the task,
it may be time for a new party to take on that responsibility. The
formation of a new party — a regular occurrence in any other democracy —
is hampered only by our lack of imagination.</p>
