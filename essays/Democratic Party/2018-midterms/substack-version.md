Midterm [elections](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elesched/schedidx.htm) will be here in fifteen months. Every seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and a third of all Senate seats will be up for grabs. The state Democratic primaries will be here long before that, but nobody seems to be worried â€” except maybe the [worry-warts](http://prospect.org/article/getting-serious-about-2018) and [Cassandras](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/306210-10-senate-seats-that-could-flip-in-2018) who see disaster unfolding.

Democrats are divided on moving right or moving left, so instead the party has chosen "we're against Trump" as its anthem. Massachusetts Democrats heard a five-hour preview of this song at the June 3rd convention in Worcester. But merely opposing Trump has limited appeal to Republicans, unenrolled voters, and [progressives](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/s4p?source=ORem170718). Instead, voters are asking: *What have you done for me lately?* And: *What do you really stand for?*

Democratic leaders [say](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/05/democrats-trump-congress-better-deal-240150) they are working on something great (sounds like Trump) but they're in no rush to let American voters in on their secret. When Democrats finally do come up with a new platform, as [POLITICO](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/05/democrats-trump-congress-better-deal-240150) points out, even if it is progressive, centrist Democrats say they'll chart their own political course. Words are cheap. Platforms apparently are even cheaper.

Democrats face not only apathy and division but a demographic crisis. According to the non-partisan Voter Participation Center at [Lake Research](http://data.voterparticipation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Report.VPC_.Drop-Off.fi_.2017.06.29.pdf), the "Rising American Electorate" (millennials, unmarried women, and people of color) are more likely to stay home for 2018 midterm elections or remain unenrolled than in 2012. In Massachusetts the net loss is expected to be 12.7%, while in states like New Mexico it may be as high as 29.6%. A total of [40 million Americans](https://web.archive.org/web/20170916153814/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/40-million-fewer-people-expected-to-vote-in-2018-study-finds/ar-AAovM0F) will drop out of the electoral process. And unfortunately they won't be Trump voters.

If Democrats cannot agree on a platform, they should at least make [voting rights](http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/06/14/to-have-a-chance-in-2018-democrats-need-to-go-on-the-offensive-in-the-voting-wars/) and voter registration a major effort. But so far it's been radio silence from both the DNC and MassDems.

Among the [races](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elesched/schedidx.htm) coming up in Massachusetts and our slice of the SouthCoast:

-   Elizabeth Warren is up for re-election but her victory is [far from assured](http://www.politico.com/states/massachusetts/story/2017/01/polls-shows-warren-is-no-sure-bet-for-re-election-next-year-108924).

-   All nine U.S. Congressmen seem likely to run [unopposed in the primaries](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2016/year_to:2016/office_id:5/stage:Democratic/show_details:1) as they did two years ago, although in 2012 Sam Sutter [challenged](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/candidates/view/C-Samuel-Sutter) Bill Keating (9th Congressional district) in the Democratic primary and got a surprising 40% of the vote.

-   Republican Governor Charlie Baker is up for re-election and any Democrat who wants to take on the telegenic and personable (but nevertheless Republican) governor really needs to emerge as a strong challenger long before the March primaries.

-   William Francis Galvin ran [unopposed](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2014/year_to:2014/office_id:45/stage:Democratic/show_details:1) for Secretary of the Commonwealth in the 2014 primaries, and we'll probably see a repeat of this in 2018.

-   Popular Attorney General Maura Healey is clearly running an aggressive re-election campaign, taking no chances.

-   Treasurer Deb Goldberg had two primary challengers in 2014 and squeaked by with [55% of the vote](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2014/year_to:2014/office_id:53/stage:General/show_details:1) in the 2014 general election. Republicans will be gunning for her job again this year.

-   Auditor Suzanne Bump [won with 57%](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2014/year_to:2014/office_id:90/stage:Primaries/show_details:1) in the 2014 general election and ran unopposed in the primaries.

-   Governor's Council member Joseph C. Ferreira (1st district), who ran unopposed in both the 2014 and 2016 primaries and also unopposed in both general elections, will likely run for his campaigning-free [\$36K a year](https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220225/http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/herald_bulldog/2015/07/pay_hike_for_governors_council_approved_by_gov) job.

-   State Senator Mark Montigny (2nd Bristol and Plymouth), who has generally run [unopposed in both primaries and general elections](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/candidates/view/Mark-C-Montigny) since 1992, will be up for re-election.

-   State Representative Christopher Markey (9th Bristol) is up for re-election. Markey has had periodic [challengers](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/candidates/view/Christopher-M-Markey) (Alan Garcia, Patrick Curran, Joe Michaud, Russel Protentis, Robert Tavares, Raymond Medeiros) but the conservative Democrat has somehow clung to his [\$75K part-time job](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Commonwealth-of-Massachusetts-State-Representative-Salaries-E143286_D_KO30,50.htm).

-   In 2014 Bristol County Commissioner John Saunders was challenged in the primaries by Daniel Dermody but [ran unopposed](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2014/year_to:2014/office_id:533/stage:General/show_details:1) in the general election.

-   In 2014 Sam Sutter ran for Bristol County District Attorney and had [no challengers](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/candidates/view/C-Samuel-Sutter) in either the primary or the general election.

-   In 2016 Thomas M. Quinn ran for Bristol County District Attorney and had [no challengers](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/candidates/view/Thomas-M-Quinn-III) in either the primary or the general election.

-   A couple of bland part-time positions offer six-year terms, nice salaries, and generally few challengers:

-   Mark J. Santos has run [unopposed for the last 18 years](http://electionstats.state.ma.us/candidates/view/Marc-J-Santos) as Bristol County Clerk of Courts. There have been no primary or general election challengers in all this time for his [\$110K job](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2014/02/12/salary/hfNNu0PRJqdJIIgXFbeWDP/story.html).

-   In announcing his retirement last March, Mark Treadup, a former school board member, former city councilman, former state representative, former county treasurer, former county commissioner, and former member of the Governor's Council, [bequeathed](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20170113/register-of-deeds-mark-treadup-stepping-aside-in-march) his most recent job as Career Democrat to Susan A. Morris, but it was given instead to fomer New Bedford mayor [Fred Kalisz](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20170303/former-new-bedford-mayor-kalisz-appointed-as-register-of-deeds) to finish out Treadup's term.

At this late date Democrats are unlikely to get their act together. Careerism, apathy, and division can't be cured overnight. And voter trust remains the critical issue. A party's actions will always speak louder than platforms and promises.
