**Progressive Massachusetts** is asking voters to call or email state representatives to preserve the best — and reject the worst — of a lengthy list of proposed amendments to the [FY2019 House Budget](https://www.progressivemass.com/fy2019_house_budget).

Most of the amendments are quite positive — funding for recently-passed criminal justice reforms, education, environment, and for the state's most vulnerable citizens. Many amendments reflect policy changes needed in education, immigration, policing, transportation, the environment, and public assistance. You can find a full [list of the amendments here](https://www.progressivemass.com/fy2019_house_budget).

But Republicans — and one Dartmouth state representative — have sneaked in policy amendments which either gut or damage civil rights and civil liberties protections: 

- Amendments [113](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/113/House/Preview) (**Lombardo**), [227](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/227/House/Preview) (**Diehl**), and [347](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/347/House/Preview) (**Lyons**), which would would create even broader authority for police to detain immigrants or punish the 31 cities and towns that have adopted measures to limit police participation in immigration enforcement.
- Amendment [508](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/508/House/Preview) (**Jones**), which would attempt to pass Governor Baker’s unconstitutional proposal to overturn the Lunn decision via the budget.
- Amendments [515](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/515/House/Preview) (**Jones**) and [1174](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/1174/House/Preview) (**Markey**), which would expand state wiretap powers to “listen in” on a wider range of personal communication.
- Amendment [979](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/GetAmendmentContent/190/H4400/979/House/Preview) (**Howitt**), which would curtail the right to free expression, namely the use of economic boycotts against foreign governments (recall the boycott movement against apartheid South Africa). This legislation was originally co-sponsored by several local state representatives who should be asked to repudiate their previous support for it.

Unfortunately Dartmouth Democratic Rep. **Christopher Markey** uniquely joins Republicans Diehl, Howitt, Jones, Lombardo, and Lyons in Progressive Massachusetts' rogue's gallery. 

The House votes on the amendments next week — so it's critical you call or email your representatives ASAP:
