*Massachusetts Democrats are getting ready for the 2018 convention in Worcester. The following information might be useful if you are thinking of jumping into the Blue pool.*

**The MassDems Convention**

The 2018 Massachusetts Democratic convention is an *Endorsing Convention* — which means that state primary candidates will be vetted at the convention. To appear on the Democratic primary ballot on September 4th, candidates need 15% of the convention delegate vote, so you may have noticed that candidates are scrambling to contact party activists. This year's convention is also considering charter amendments — changing the rules by which the state party operates. *Action Together* has a good writeup on what will go on at the convention:

*Action Together* also has a good summary of how you can jump in:

**First things first**

Start by attending your Democratic town caucus. You can't be a delegate if you're not attached to a local committee. Today was the first day of the caucuses. Check to see when yours is being held:

**A little light reading**

The rules for delegates, alternates and "add-on" delegate selections will leave you with heartburn and a headache. In general, there are an equal number of male and female delegates and alternates. There are also a number of "add-on" delegates, also gender-balanced, who represent various identities: minority, gender, sexuality, disabled, etc.

You must be registered as a Democrat at the time of your town caucus to be elected as a delegate or alternate. Add-on delegates can register as Democrats at the caucuses. Delegates must be present at the caucuses unless they are serving in the military, and they must not have publicly supported non-Democrats within the last 2-4 years. There may be some exceptions for absences at the caucuses if prior notice has been given in writing to the local chair. Consult your local chair and familiarize yourself with the Convention documents and the various forms and registration deadlines. And don't show up late for your caucus!
