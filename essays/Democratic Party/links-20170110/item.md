Some people are going to wait until Inauguration Day or until all of Trump's cabinet picks have been confirmed before rending their garments, moving to Nova Scotia, or getting politically engaged.

But if you're ready to do something right now, you've got plenty of options, some close to home:

- [Massachusetts Democratic Party](http://www.massdems.org/) - many towns do not yet have functioning town committees
- [Coalition for Social Justice](http://www.coalitionforsocialjustice.org/) - issues-based advocacy, strategic political endorsements
- [Progressive Massachusetts](http://www.progressivemass.com/) - born out of the Obama campaign
- [Progressive Democrats of MA](http://www.progressivedemsofmass.org/) - born out of Duval Patrick's campaign
- [Progressive Democrats of America](http://pdamerica.org/) - born out of campaigns of Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich
- [Democracy for America](http://democracyforamerica.com/) - Howard Dean's PAC, but also a hub for information and activism
- [Our Revolution](https://ourrevolution.com/) and [Transform the Party](http://transformtheparty.com/) - Bernie Sanders fights on
- [Southeast MA Revolution Meetup](https://go.ourrevolution.com/page/event/detail/gplljx) - sign up for Our Revolution meetings in Fall River
