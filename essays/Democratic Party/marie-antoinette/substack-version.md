White House apparatchik/ consiglieri/ mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway doesn't think Trump's famous economic "carnage" is bad enough to throw a Medicaid lifeline to the working poor.

Sounding as out-of-touch and cruel as Marie Antoinette, Conway appeared on ABC's "This Week" and said that jobless Medicaid recipients should [just go out and get a job](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kellyanne-conway-defends-medicaid-cuts-says-adults-can-always-find-jobs_us_594fce98e4b05c37bb770cb7). "If they are able-bodied and they want to work, then they'll have employer-sponsored benefits like you and I do."

*Yeah*, you lazy slackers. Why didn't *you* think of that? Go get a job with *her* benefits.

For a political party that has so aggressively courted the poor white vote, this is a slap in the face to the very people who tipped the election in Trump's favor. Of course, the working poor includes both Trump and non-Trump voters alike, and millions of minorities, but very few get medical and retirement benefits. Just ask Walmart workers who quality for food stamps and Medicaid because they work for unlivable wages. Kellyanne Conway's suggestion would be laughable if it were not so callous.

Conway, who once ran a SuperPAC for billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and recently bought an \$8 million mansion in suburban Washington D.C., spins steer manure for a living. But she doesn't even have to believe it. For every lie she tells Conway is paid handsomely. And the medical benefits are great.

Now certainly the Democratic Party is guilty of turning its back on American workers. But out in the woodshed Democrats are taking a much more savage beating than the GOP, which is now doing the cruelest damage to the working class. And yet Trump & Company continue to receive applause for "promises kept" from this base.

It may take four years for Trump voters to realize the severity of their mistake â€” some people only learn things the hard way. But when American voters finally realize what the GOP has done to them, and to whom Trump's promises were actually made, they're not going to like Marie Antoinette and her boss at all.
