#### Leftovers, at best

While Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi think their [Better Deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/forget-a-better-deal-heres-what-would-actually-work-for-democrats/2017/07/24/3865e556-70a9-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8_story.html) will be a tasty voter treat, it's basically leftover Democratic meat loaf warmed up in the microwave -- with an extra splosh of Worcester Sauce. It is the underwhelming work of a timid party trying to crawl back into a [nonexistent center](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/dems-can-abandon-the-center-because-the-center-doesnt-exist.html). 

#### A Better Better Deal

Meanwhile, the [Summer for Progress](https://summerforprogress.com/platform) is a substantial portfolio of seven progressive bills covering wages, health care, education, taxation, voting rights, environmental protection and reproductive choice. The seven bills are supported by two dozen progressive organizations and represent a bold vision for the country. 

More importantly, this is not a hodge-podge of neo-Liberal gimmicks but a comprehensive vision for what America could become. And it's a vision of what kind of America we'll need after the Trump administration finishes with their wrecking ball.

Think of the Summer for Progress as a *better* Better Deal.

But the legislation could use a lot more Congressional love. Despite a *very* progressive state Democratic Party [platform](https://massdems.org/platform) that *affirms almost everything in the Summer for Progress* platform, very [few Massachusetts Democrats](/Democratic Party/better-deal/) actually support any of the legislation. 

Well, this is their big chance to show that there's more to Democrats than just empty rhetoric. Call your Democratic legislators and ask them why have not co-sponsored any of the [seven bills](https://summerforprogress.com/petition).

If Democrats won't even support their own platforms and are only prepared to serve voters unappetizing leftovers, how do you think the midterm elections are going to end?
