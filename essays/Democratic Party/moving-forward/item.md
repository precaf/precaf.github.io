Last Fall I attended weekly political discussions which, sadly, ended after the election. Our group ran quite the gamut of political views, but despite a few moments of heat we were usually able to hear each other. Hats off to Ken Hartnett, emeritus editor at the Standard Times, for making such civility possible.

I don't know if something of this sort already exists, but I'd like to know if anyone is interested in an independent political forum here in the SouthCoast (of Massachusetts). Something issues-based. Something welcoming to both mainstream and progressive Democrats and not intimately wedded to the local party machinery. Something with a reliable venue, a reasonable schedule, speakers, opportunities for discussion -- in person and continued online.

I miss discussing politics with real people. More importantly, we have a lot to figure out together these next four years, especially as centrist and left-oriented Democrats kiss, make up, and move forward together.

A good example of this is out in Maricopa County, Arizona â€” home of \[thankfully *former*\] sheriff Joe Arpaio. There Democrats and Progressives are as rare as water and as endangered a species as the white-sided jackrabbit (I'm not making this up). But misery loves company and out in the desert both True Blue Democrats and Berniecrats are moving forward together. Their [Blog for Arizona](http://blogforarizona.net/) is always interesting and models nicely how we in the center and on the left could be working together.

Let me know what you think.
