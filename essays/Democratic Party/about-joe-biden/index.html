<p>It doesn’t take much to keep a 72 year-old man up at night. And
caffeine and over-hydration are not what I’m talking about. What worries
me is the country’s race toward fascism, cheered on to the
<em>amens</em> of fake-Christian nationalists and accompanied by the
angry whiteboy tunes of Jason Aldean’s “Try That in a Small Town” or
Oliver Anthony’s “Rich Men North of Richmond.”</p>
<p>But right at the top of my worry list is the Democrat Party’s lack of
concern that its presumptive nominee, the current president, is such a
bad choice he could actually <em>lose</em> against an opponent with 91
criminal indictments. That’s not just <em>my</em> opinion; it’s a view
supported by multiple polls (for example, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/upshot/biden-trump-poll-2024.html">here</a>
and <a
target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-most-americans-say-biden-and-trump-are-not-fit-to-serve-as-president-133443536.html">here</a>
and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/why-joe-biden-could-lose-in-2024/ar-AA1bXrXJ">here</a>).
Joe Biden’s candidacy is <em>such</em> a terrifying prospect that it is
irresponsible for the DNC to <em>not</em> be looking for a replacement.
And it would be irresponsible <em>not</em> to be writing essays like
this one.</p>
<h4 id="bidenomics"><strong>Bidenomics</strong></h4>
<p>Aside from the fact that he’s not Donald J. Trump — which is really
the only reason to vote for him — Biden’s entire campaign is based on
“<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/01/joe-biden-bidenomics-2024-reelection-economy">Bidenomics</a>,”
a time-worn bag of post-Keynesian tricks for tweaking the economy. By
traditional measures that consider inflation, the consumer price index,
the health of the investment industry, the value of the dollar, personal
debt, consumer spending, or view “employment” generously to include
those working three dead-end jobs at a time or “gig economy” jobs
without benefits, “Bidenomics” is going gangbusters. Biden’s bag of
tricks, according to his <a
target="_blank" href="https://punchbowl.news/wp-content/uploads/6.22.23-WH-Bidenomics-Deck.pdf">PowerPoints</a>
and dry <a
target="_blank" href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2023/06/26/6499151fe4b02f808ab6d82a.pdf">talking
points</a>, is “working.”</p>
<p>“Bidenomics” is no doubt the product of some genius’s riff on
“Reaganomics,” the trickle-down theory that what benefits Big Business
must ultimately help the American worker. By now almost everyone knows
trickle-down economics was a big lie, what another Republican called
“voodoo economics.” And maybe that’s the problem: Americans are simply
tired of having their Presidents <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/politics/fact-check-biden-amtrak-grandfather-pittsburgh-bridge-debt/index.html">lie
to them</a> about economic policies. Whatever its merits, Bidenomics was
destined to fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Yet for all the centrist Democratic cheerleading (see examples <a
target="_blank" href="https://roberthubbell.substack.com/p/bidenomics-is-real-just-ask-a-republican">here</a>
or <a

target="_blank" href="https://www.msnbc.com/ali-velshi/watch/for-facts-sake-bidenomics-is-working-especially-in-red-states-188537925701">here</a>)
Americans have not been convinced by Bidenomics’s rosy numbers. The
title of a recent article by <a
target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-says-the-economys-doing-great-lots-of-his-own-voters-dont-believe-him/">Monica
Potts</a> in FiveThirtyEight says it all: “Biden Says The Economy’s
Doing Great. Lots Of His Own Voters Don’t Believe Him.” Americans’ <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.levernews.com/bidenomics-isnt-working-for-working-people/">precarious</a>
personal finances are rarely acknowledged. It’s not the health of the
dollar, the Dow, the Consumer Confidence index, or even inflation that
terrifies Americans. Millions of Americans are <a

insecurity</a> and financial hardship are only <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.levernews.com/bidenomics-isnt-working-for-working-people/">worsening</a>.</p>
<p>And then there’s Biden himself.</p>
<h4 id="voters-just-dont-want-biden"><strong>Voters just don’t want
Biden</strong></h4>
<p>Reflecting America’s misery and hopelessness, Biden’s abysmally <a
target="_blank" href="https://jacobin.com/2023/08/joe-biden-pandemic-relief-economy-poverty/">low
approval</a> ratings from working people shouldn’t come as any surprise.
An <a
target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-poll-economy-survey-jobs-inflation-b3c77cb208f96f9b039cf48cbc4fb67b">AP-NORC
poll</a> found only 34% of Americans approve of Biden’s economic
leadership. 78% say the economy is fair or poor, according to a New York
Times Cross-Tabs <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/01/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voters-crosstabs.html">survey</a>.
A Reuters-Ipsos <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/reutersipsos-survey-perceptions-economy-impact-bidens-approval-and-chances-2024#:~:text=A%20majority%20of%20Americans%20say,reducing%20economic%20inequality%20(52%).">survey</a>
found that 69% of Americans think the economy has deteriorated since
Biden assumed the Presidency. Biden’s popularity with <a
target="_blank" href="https://lithub.com/jacinda-townsend-on-why-democrats-are-skeptical-of-president-biden-and-how-he-can-win-them-back/">Black
voters</a> has dropped from 82% to 52% in three years. A Yahoo/YouGov <a
target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-most-americans-say-biden-and-trump-are-not-fit-to-serve-as-president-133443536.html">poll</a>
found that only 27% of Americans thought Biden was fit to be President
compared to 31% who felt the same about Trump. Here in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2023/02/10/poll-joe-biden-2024-run-for-reelection/">Massachusetts</a>,
59% would prefer that Biden never run again.</p>
<p>Why, then, doesn’t the Democratic Party believe any of these
people?</p>
<h4 id="ignoring-people-believing-pundits"><strong>Ignoring people,
believing pundits</strong></h4>
<p>FiveThirtyEight’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-americans-arent-feeling-bidenomics/">Galen
Drake</a> and guests made a good-faith effort to explain the disconnect
in “Why Americans Aren’t Feeling ‘Bidenomics’.” Jeanna Smialek, who
covers the Fed for the New York Times, suggested, “inflation feels worse
than the job market feels good.” Axios’s chief economic correspondent
Neil Irwin, conjectured that the disconnect was due to diminished
earning power. To their credit, they actually looked for missing
datapoints to explain the disconnect.</p>
<p>Compared to that, however, liberals seem to be consuming a lot of
sweet, empty calories in the many puff pieces written to defend
Bidenomics. The New Republic’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/174556/drives-blind-denial-economic-good-news">Timothy
Noah</a> simply pooh-poohed Bidenomics’s critics, asking “What Drives
Blind Denial of Economic Good News?” His TNR Colleague <a
target="_blank" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173904/biden-democrats-wake-hell-up">Michael
Tomasky</a> called Biden a “terrific president” and chastised Democrats
for not being enthusiastic enough: “Democrats are walking around in some
state of somnolent indifference about Joe Biden. They need to snap out
of it.” The American Prospect’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/politics/2023-06-30-can-democrats-sell-bidenomics/">Ryan
Cooper</a> asked, “Can Democrats Sell ‘Bidenomics’?” Then proceeded to
write off Americans’ lack of enthusiasm for Bidenomics as unchallenged
propaganda from the right, claiming: “Most ordinary voters appear to be
doing reasonably well in their own personal finances. Witness the
consumer confidence index, which recently hit the <a
target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-spending-economy-inflation-9988737f7e68178328df41b113cb32c6">highest
level since January 2022</a>, before the major inflation surge. But then
they turn on the news each night and hear dire stories about inflation,
supply chain difficulties, housing prices, interest rates, and so on,
with little or no consistent pushback from Democrats.”</p>
<p>I’m not so willing to dismiss voters’ own assessments of Biden.
They’re the ones voting in 2024, not the pundits.</p>
<h4 id="biden-the-faux-unionist"><strong>Biden the faux
unionist</strong></h4>
<p>For all his “Joey Scranton” <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/politics/fact-check-biden-amtrak-grandfather-pittsburgh-bridge-debt/index.html">shtik</a></em>,
Biden is not, and has never been, a genuine champion of working class
Americans. Biden may have had working class parents, but he began his
professional life as a lawyer, owns four homes, is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2023/08/17/heres-how-much-joe-biden-is-worth/?sh=71a0914138ea">worth</a>
at least $10 million, and since 1972 has had a guaranteed pension and
healthcare from the Senate. In the negative sense that most Americans
experience it, Biden has never had to “work” a day in his life.</p>
<p>While “Union Joe” claims to be the most pro-union president in U.S.
history, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://revolvingdoorproject.substack.com/p/its-time-for-union-joe-to-prove-himself?r=5r98">Revolving
Door Project</a> notes Biden’s “encouraging” appointments to key
executive positions in his administration — <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/15/jennifer-abruzzo-union-biden-nlrb/">Jennifer
Abruzzo</a> to General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB), <a
target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/julie-su-biden-labor-secretary-confirmation-hearing-d57623a661fe099a4c9cf0934bd02821">Julie
Su</a> to Labor Secretary at the Department of Labor. “Unfortunately,
the list of the administrations’ pro-labor achievements basically ends
there.” The article goes on to mention chronic underfunding of the
National Labor Relations Board, his breaking of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-block-us-railroad-strike-2022-12-02/">rail
strike</a> last November, the UAW’s concern about Biden’s reckless
funding for non-union automotive startups, and Labor’s absence from
trade deal negotiations.</p>
<p>For instance, Biden’s “Build Back Better” program promised to reverse
the corporate takeover of trade policy seen in the NAFTA and TPP
agreements. But with the new corporate-led <a
target="_blank" href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/a-corporate-led-trade-agenda-is-the-wrong-path-forward/">Indo-Pacific
Economic Framework</a>, Biden’s business-as-usual approach consists of
giving an outsized voice to corporations in matters of trade policy.</p>
<h4 id="biden-and-the-democrats"><strong>Biden and the
Democrats</strong></h4>
<p>As party leader, Joe Biden may be skillfully holding the Democratic
“big tent” together with chewing gum, bailing wire, and duct tape. But
the tent is a centrist tent, always has been, and always will be. Those
of us who are not centrists get cranky when we see that the party could
be a much more effective and passionate advocate for average Americans
than it is. But face it: the Democratic Party operates on corporate
largesse and the Democratic National Committee (<a
target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-08-16-democratic-national-convention-chairs-firm-helps-companies-block-labor-laws/">DNC</a>)
itself just hired a union-busting consultant leading an effort to
deprive workers of labor protections. The current DNC Chair is <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison">Jaime Harrison</a>,
among other things a former lobbyist with the Podesta Group, which
services major U.S. corporations. Chris Korge is the DNC’s Finance
chair. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Korge">Korge</a> too
is a former lobbyist, fundraiser, and real estate developer.</p>
<h4 id="mixed-signals-on-abortion"><strong>Mixed signals on
Abortion</strong></h4>
<p>You might recall that Biden was not endorsed by <a
target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/447065-naral-hits-biden-for-support-of-controversial-abortion-rule/">NARAL</a>
in 2019 because of his support for the <a
target="_blank" href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12167">Hyde
Amendment</a>, which bars using federal funds for abortion. Just this
year, when asked his views on Roe v Wade (he <em>does</em> feel the
Supreme Court “got it right” back then), Biden <em>still</em> couldn’t
resist showing where he <em>actually</em> <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-abortion-catholic-faith-roe-v-wade-got-it-right/">stands</a>:
“I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion.” Despite the mixed
signals, and to be fair, Biden does actually support abortion and
contraception — and NARAL finally endorsed him this year. But with
abortion and contraception threatened nationally, an 80 year-old guy
with needlessly-vocalized reservations may not be the best choice to
fight for reproductive rights for women.</p>
<h4 id="defending-private-prisons"><strong>Defending Private
Prisons</strong></h4>
<p>Despite publicly opposing private prisons, Biden’s administration
filed suit against the state of New Jersey citing the “Supremacy Clause”
in the Constitution in a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23881937-20230719_doj_statementofintent">case</a>
in which New Jersey was trying to get rid of private prisons operated by
CoreCivic.</p>
<h4 id="supporting-the-surveillance-state"><strong>Supporting the
Surveillance State</strong></h4>
<p>The Biden administration announced its <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/28/biden-administration-warrantless-surveillance-law-section-702">intention</a>
to renew <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/section-702s-unconstitutional-domestic-spying-program-must-end">Section
702</a> of the invasive and unconstitutional Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA).</p>
<h4 id="a-long-history-of-racism"><strong>A long history of
racism</strong></h4>
<p>Many people have not forgiven Biden for his 1975 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html">anti-busing</a>
crusade that the NAACP called “an anti-black amendment”, or <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-joe-biden-hasnt-owned-up-to-about-anita-hill">his
shabby treatment</a> of Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas’s Senate
confirmation hearings in 1991. Over a long and damaging career in the
Senate, Biden managed to be associated with all types of <a
target="_blank" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/joe-biden-record-on-busing-incarceration-racial-justice-democratic-primary-2020-explained.html">racist
legislation</a> — attaching the death penalty to over 60 crimes, minimum
sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses, civil asset forfeiture, and
establishing different sentencing for powder vs. crack cocaine. Biden
demonized “super-predators” and attacked George H.W. Bush for being soft
on crime.</p>
<p>In 2020, when Biden was campaigning, he was asked about <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4p7p/joe-biden-just-said-undecided-black-voters-arent-really-black-in-a-train-wreck-of-an-interview">undecided
Black voters</a>. His reply shocked everyone: “If you’ve got a problem
figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” That
same year 500 Asian-Americans asked Biden to take down a <a
target="_blank" href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/biden-trump-china-racism-asian-american-groups-military-pivot-covid">racist
anti-China ad</a> that his campaign created.</p>
<p>Last year Biden proposed $30 billion in funding to hire <a
target="_blank" href="https://blackagendareport.com/biden-proposes-30-billion-policing">more
police</a>, a move critics slammed as a betrayal of Black people and one
completely <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2021/01/11/biden-police-panel-blm-racial-justice">hostile</a>
to appeals for demilitarizing and slimming police forces. Biden’s DOJ
argued that people born in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.latinorebels.com/2021/09/17/bidenharrisinsularcases/">U.S.
territories</a> do not have a Constitutional right to U.S.
citizenship.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, during his presidency Biden’s support from <a
target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-approval-black-hispanic-voters/">Black
and Hispanic voters</a> has been tanking.</p>
<h4 id="sticking-with-trumps-immigration-policies"><strong>Sticking with

<p>Biden retained Trump’s restrictive <a
target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/latino/548710-democratic-senator-rips-biden-for-keeping-trumps-refugee-cap/">refugee
caps</a> as well as Trump’s Title 42 asylum denials (on the basis of
public health) longer than necessary.</p>
<h4 id="botching-student-debt-relief"><strong>Botching Student debt

<p>After <a

version 1.0 of his own student debt relief program, the Supreme Court
literally manufactured a plaintiff without standing to gut student debt
relief. Biden’s “Plan B” is <a
target="_blank" href="https://truthout.org/articles/student-debt-activists-say-bidens-response-to-scotus-is-designed-to-fail/">predicated</a>
upon the Department of Education invoking the Higher Education Act to

<h4 id="no-support-for-enlarging-the-supreme-court"><strong>No support

<p>Both Massachusetts senators and a large number of Senators and House

on board</a>.</p>
<h4 id="sacrificing-the-social-safety-net"><strong>Sacrificing the

<p>Progressive Democrats were not happy about Biden’s cuts to Medicaid,

to resolve the <a

“To our many allies and partners in Congress who have <em>claimed</em>
to support Black Livers, we are grateful for your past support and need
you to know: this is a moment of choosing.” In gutting social programs
for the most vulnerable in society, Biden and the Democrats <a

foreign policy</a> is driven by three war hawks: Anthony Blinken, Jake
Sullivan, and <a

Nuland</a> (who most famously was recorded in 2014 ordering up a new
Ukrainian president).</p>
<p>Biden’s neocon war whisperers have him continuing to <a

NATO</a>, selling <a

munitions</a> to Ukraine, and raising <a

Intelligence <a

Haines</a> is another hawk who supports torture and managed to conceal
CIA spying on senators from Congress. Biden has continued the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.juancole.com/2022/01/americas-bombing-dropped.html">secret
wars</a> of his predecessors, including weekly drone attacks. He won’t
even call the <a

in Niger (by US-trained generals) a <em>coup</em>.</p>
<p>There is no authoritarian state Biden won’t <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/biden-democracy-autocracy.html">praise</a>.
From Israel to <a
target="_blank" href="https://fpif.org/why-i-crashed-the-white-houses-garden-party-for-narendra-modi/">India</a>,
Saudi Arabia, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines, it’s White House visits,
state dinners, hugs and fist bumps — even for a Saudi dictator who
dismembered a Saudi-American journalist. As long as there is a strategic
objective, Biden will turn on the flattery for any <a
target="_blank" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173752/what-happened-biden-human-rights-agenda-modi">authoritarian</a>
regime.</p>
<p>Biden blocked resumption of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/21/iran-nuclear-deal-biden-irgc/">Iran
nuclear deal</a> that Trump abrogated in 2018 by introducing new
preconditions and <a
target="_blank" href="https://newrepublic.com/post/169664/biden-iran-nuclear-deal-dead">pronouncing</a>
the original agreement “dead.” Recently, Biden recklessly placed 3,000
troops on commercial ships in the Persian Gulf, a move that the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/03/armed-marines-iran-ship-seizures/">Washington
Post</a> called a “remarkable escalation” with Iran.</p>
<p>The President is betting the ranch on a Saudi-Israeli <a

deal</a> which would (besides spinning mendacious fantasies of a
Two-State solution) give Saudi Arabia a package of military aid,
replenish Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s empty tank of political
capital, reduce Saudi flirtations with China, and aim more nukes at
Iran. As <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/biden-middle-east-deal-saudi-arabia-bad-idea.html?via=rss">Fred
Kaplan</a> points out in <em>Slate</em>, this is an incredibly stupid
idea: “Would the mullahs of Tehran hold still if their mortal enemies in
Riyadh suddenly signed accords that gave them nuclear technology and
formal military backing from Washington? It is a fair bet that they
would accelerate their uranium-enriching programs if just to obtain a
deterrent.”</p>
<h4 id="environmental-policy-in-the-dumpster"><strong>Environmental
policy in the dumpster</strong></h4>
<p>Biden began his presidency by naming <a
target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/environment/bidens-oil-friendly-appointees/">Big
Oil appointees</a> to the State Department. He then set about rolling
out <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-change-2024-election-biden/">pipelines</a>,
LNG terminals and has <a
target="_blank" href="https://ips-dc.org/bidens-dangerous-climate-hypocrisy/">permitted</a>
more gas and oil exploration on public lands than Trump, including in
the <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next/2023/03/willow-biden-conocophillips-oil-alaska">Arctic</a>.
In May and June 2022 the Biden Administration <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/biden-administration-spearheads-massive-public-lands-giveaway">auctioned
off</a> more than 140,000 acres of public land for gas and oil
development.</p>
<p>Rather than boosting alternative energy, Biden has embraced carbon <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/as-biden-touts-clean-energy-perks-of-inflation-reduction-act-he-moves-in-opposite-direction-with-new-fossil-fuel-projects-faulty-carbon-capture-schemes">capture</a>
and carbon accounting schemes that do little to actually reduce
environmental CO2. And environmentalists have noticed: “We don’t want to
see New Mexico have a continued legacy of sacrifice zones, so we’re here
demanding the ending of fossil fuels and investment in renewable
energies,” said Julia Bernal, the executive director of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.puebloactionalliance.org/">Pueblo Action Alliance</a>
on the <a
target="_blank" href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/08/10/during-visit-to-nm-locals-demand-president-biden-phase-out-fossil-fuels/">occasion</a>
of a Biden visit to New Mexico. “No hydrogen, no carbon sequestration,
and no false solutions in general.”</p>
<p>In August, under Biden, US <a
target="_blank" href="https://whowhatwhy.org/science/environment/biden-and-republicans-share-a-dirty-little-secret/">crude
oil production</a> actually hit a new all-time high. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/food-water-watch">Food &amp;
Water Watch</a> Executive Director Wenonah Hauter blasted Biden’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/white-house-s-muddled-methane-message">hypocrisy</a>,
especially on methane which is a byproduct of fracking: “If the White
House is serious about reducing methane pollution, it should [ban]
fracking and [prohibit] the use of methane for heating in new
construction. President Biden should also use his executive authority to
stop the buildout of new gas infrastructure, ban the export of methane
in the form of liquified natural gas, and stop fracking on federal lands
as he promised during the campaign. […] So far, White House policies
have bolstered the interests of corporate polluters by dramatically
increasing fossil fuel permits and aggressively promoting the growth of
fracked gas exports – a catastrophic move that will increase methane
pollution and keep countries hooked on fossil fuels for decades.”</p>
<p>Disappointingly, Biden’s DOJ <a
target="_blank" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571d109b04426270152febe0/t/6495f4ba6e22033fdcce8c22/1687549116699/Doc+547+2023.06.22+MTD+Second+Amended+Complaint.pdf">maintains</a>
that “there is no constitutional right to a stable climate system.” And,
even with the world burning and melting, he <em>still</em> won’t declare
a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/27/joe-biden-climate-emergency-peter-kalmus">climate
emergency</a>. This is a president who may talk the talk but says “nah”
to the walk.</p>
<h4 id="biden-or-not"><strong>Biden or not?</strong></h4>
<p>These are only a <em>few</em> of the many reasons no one should ever
vote for Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But after all of the foregoing, here’s the <em>one and only</em>
reason I still may end up voting for him.</p>
<p>I might prefer a particular third-party candidate for his love of all
the values I care about — a candidate whose morality and humanity extend
even to democracy and human rights outside the United States. A
candidate who mercifully drops the American exceptionalist jingoism and
instead looks critically at how race, class, and inequality play out in
our nation. A man who is actually willing to do something to solve real
problems for real people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is absolutely no chance that this principled man
will ever win the next election. And there is every chance a fascist
will return with his “base” to deliver the <em>coup de grâce</em> to our
dying democracy.</p>
<p>Many are <a
target="_blank" href="https://progressive.org/op-eds/dont-run-joe-cook-220721/">calling
for</a> Biden to step aside. That includes <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/over-half-democrats-want-party-back-alternative-biden-2024-poll-1678772">half</a>
of all Democrats. And that includes me. I have hopefully given readers
sufficient reason to do the same. <em>However</em>, if and when it
becomes clear that no hope for an alternative to Biden remains, I will
join in supporting him over the fascist with the spray-on tan and an
army of pitchfork, bible, and AR15-wielding nut jobs.</p>
<p>But I hope the Democratic Party will come to its senses long before
that happens and select a better, stronger, more appealing, and more
principled candidate for President of the United States.</p>
