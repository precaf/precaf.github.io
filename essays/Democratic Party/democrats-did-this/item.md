Today Marion Davis of MIRA issued a [press release](https://mailchi.mp/miracoalition/mass-legislature-abdicates-moral-leadership-in-budget-deal-3238105) announcing that the Democratic-majority legislature had abdicated moral leadership by stripping four immigrant protection provisions from the 2019 budget. It echoed U.S. Congressional Democrats doing much [the same thing last January](https://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Local-reaction-to-stopgap-budget-plan-470595413.html). Sacrificing immigrants for budgets is becoming a Democratic habit.

In MIRA's press release, Eva A. Millona, executive director of the MIRA Coalition, was quoted:

"We are deeply disappointed. The Massachusetts Legislature had a prime opportunity to stand up for civil rights and human decency, and under political pressure from Governor Baker and conservative Democrats, it backed down. The safety and well-being of tens of thousands of immigrant families will suffer as a result."

*Democrats did this.*

"It is particularly disturbing that the Legislature succumbed to fear-mongering about 'sanctuary' policies. Though nothing in the four provisions approved by the Senate actually met the definition of 'sanctuary' used by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, prominent House members embraced nativist propaganda misrepresenting those provisions, using the falsehoods as political cover for their inaction."

*Democrats did this.*

"We find it shocking that, with this agreement, the Legislature has tacitly accepted the notion that police should be able to ask people who 'look foreign' to show their papers before they can report a crime, and that immigrants should be kept in the dark about their legal rights, so it's easier to deport them. The Legislature couldn't even agree that Massachusetts should never contribute to a Muslim registry. That is stunning and embarrassing."

*Democrats did this.*

"Our country faces an existential crisis, and in the face of horrific abuses by the federal government, it is morally imperative for states to act to protect their most vulnerable residents. By failing to pass the Safe Communities Act, and now failing to pass even basic legal protections, the Legislature has abdicated its moral leadership, and failed a large share of its constituents."

Instead, the Massachusetts House chose expediency and making a Republican governor happy.

Democrats had better fix this.
