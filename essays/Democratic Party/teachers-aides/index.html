<p>The people of Dartmouth have an important decision to make: approve a Prop 2 1/2 override to pay for increases in teachers’ pay — or continue short-changing teachers, especially those earning the least.</p>
<p>Dartmouth teachers are still working without contract while escalating healthcare costs are actually reducing their take-home pay. The town’s contract with the Dartmouth Education Association <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20191218/dartmouth-to-study-possible-prop-2-12-override-to-boost-teacher-salaries">does not include</a> steps or cost-of-living increases. And some of Dartmouth’s most economically vulnerable workers are teachers’ aides who not only have to worry about declining earnings — they’re already making sub-poverty wages.</p>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://ma02213179.schoolwires.net/cms/lib/MA02213179/Centricity/Domain/324/DEA%20TA%20Unit%2009012016%20thru%2008312019.pdf">now-expired agreement</a> between the school district and the Dartmouth Educators Association (DEA), a first-time aide without a bachelor’s degree earns $16,614 a year and the position pays a maximum of $24,206 for a six year aide with a bachelor’s degree. These salaries represent gross wages of between $9.89 and $14.30. The Massachusetts minimum wage is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-minimum-wage">$12 an hour</a>. The lowest-paid teachers’ aide — typically a woman — makes $16,614 a year in pre-tax earnings, and her estimated <a target="_blank" href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/massachusetts-tax-calculator">take home pay</a> is $14,259.</p>
<p>To put this economic and gender wage inequality in perspective, a typically male <a target="_blank" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Bristol-County-Sheriff-s-Office-Correctional-Officer-Salaries-E480539_D_KO32,52.htm">county correctional officer</a> with only a high-school degree earns between $56-$60,000 a year. And there is currently a bill in the legislature to give Massachusetts correctional officers (the fourth best paid in the country) a $100 million raise.</p>
<p>Even with the town picking up 52% of the cost of her HMO Network Blue family plan, our first-year teachers’ aide pays $6,407.73 a year for the <em>mandatory</em> town health insurance and she cannot choose a different provider. After paying almost <em>one-half</em> of her sub minimum-wage salary for healthcare, she ends up making only $7,851 a year. That’s $4.67 an hour.</p>
<p>According to Dartmouth Educators Association President <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20191009/dartmouth-teachers-picket-expenses-super-charges-violation">Renee Vieira</a>, healthcare costs rose in 2018 by 8.3% and again by 4.3% in 2019. Vieira says that the 52% contribution the school district pays is low compared to other communities.</p>
<p>One option for the union is to demand a higher town contribution for healthcare. Raising the town contribution from 52% to 60% would put another $1,068 in every teacher’s hands. With this adjustment, instead of living on just $7,851 a year, our first-time teachers’ aide would then be bringing home just $8,919 a <em>year</em> — for a family.</p>
<p>Addressing healthcare alone won’t help a teacher’s aide. What she really needs is better base pay. Dartmouth residents, then, are going to have to decide whether they want to save a few bucks or make their teachers work for declining — and in some cases — poverty wages. This is not only an economic but a moral choice.</p>
<p>Absent national healthcare, which would help town government and small business immeasurably, it’s clear to me that Dartmouth needs to approve a tax override and sign an agreement with teachers providing cost of living increases and more affordable healthcare. Especially if it hopes to retain quality educators.</p>
<p>Both the town and the union must also do something specifically to improve the situation for aides who skate on the edge of poverty helping children in our schools.</p>
