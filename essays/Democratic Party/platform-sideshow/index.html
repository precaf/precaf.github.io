<p>The Massachusetts Democratic <a target="_blank" href="https://massdems.org/state-caucuses-convention">convention</a> is two weeks away, and there is now a working version that will be discussed in Worcester on June 3rd. Some have applauded the new draft – including three progressive groups that contributed amendments – for being the “most progressive” Massachusetts Democratic platform in history.</p>
<h3 id="good-stuff">Good Stuff</h3>
<p>To its credit, the 2013 draft includes calls for</p>
<ul>
<li>single-payer healthcare – although it’s not clear why it also propose a hodgepodge of other healthcare programs</li>
<li>making the Commonwealth a sanctuary state</li>
<li>public funding of elections – but will the state’s Democrats <em>really</em> give up their PACs?</li>
<li>paid family leave</li>
<li>free college education – well, <em>maybe</em>, because it also calls for “exploring” debt-free models of higher education</li>
<li>a “decent living wage” – though a <em>specific</em> amount is not given</li>
<li>infrastructure development, including broadband – though no mention of regulating monopolies like Comcast or ensuring net neutrality within the state</li>
<li>a “millionaire’s tax” – along with tax breaks for “job creators”</li>
<li>universal background checks for guns –“balanced” by more money for law-enforcement</li>
<li>more money for veterans – which irks me for the same reason as the Commonwealth subsidizing ICE</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to be fair, there are many good things in the platform. But some caution.</p>
<h3 id="their-hearts-werent-in-it">Their hearts weren’t in it</h3>
<p>Massachusetts Democrats have been pushed to embrace many progressive positions they would normally have rejected – and they have been translated into ambiguities and <em>weasel-words</em>. Some positions are just a road too far for Democrats in a state that thinks it’s much more liberal than it actually is. The hearts of those who had to draft this “progressive” platform just weren’t in it.</p>
<p><img src="red-blue.png" /></p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" href="/Democratic%20Party/massdem-platform/">previous post</a> I looked at what was missing in the <a target="_blank" href="http://massdems.org/files/2013_MDP_Platform_FINAL.pdf">2013 MassDems platform</a> – and some things have indeed been fixed in a 2017 draft. At the time I observed that “the 2013 platform isn’t bad as a statement of liberal values – and the 2017 Progressives’ changes aren’t so radical as to give Democrats much heartburn.”</p>
<p>I was wrong. Apparently there was heartburn.</p>
<p>For example, the platform committee deleted the following plank from the 2013 final version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We want strong diplomacy and support nonviolent conflict resolution as a first resort in our domestic and foreign relations and call for a reduced military budget that allows for investment in human needs”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attempts by progressive delegates to insert anti-militarism and foreign policy language into the platform were flatly rejected. The word “military” only appears in the <em>Veterans</em> section. <em>Thank you for your service. Here, have some state money.</em></p>
<h3 id="whats-still-missing">What’s still missing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign Policy and Militarism</strong> – stop supporting autocratic and undemocratic regimes – no more weaponry for Saudi Arabia – slash the military budget – <strong>end undeclared wars</strong> – insist on <strong>Congress’ right to declare wars</strong> – no more aid to Israel until they end settlements – no more aid for Egypt’s dictatorship</li>
<li><strong>Democratization of the Democratic Party</strong> – will we ever be rid of superdelegates?</li>
<li><strong>End the Surveillance State</strong> – enhance citizen <strong>privacy</strong> (a word that doesn’t appear even <em>once</em> in the document) – get rid of the Patriot Act – eliminate FISA courts – get rid of or make No Fly lists transparent – breathe life back into the 4th Amendment</li>
<li><strong>End useless tax breaks</strong> – remove vague language guaranteeing favorable tax rates for “businesses that generate community growth and participation” – Wal*Mart? really?</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong> – now that EPA and Superfund money has been slashed, Massachusetts should sue for remediation (for example, Aerovox dumped PCBs in New Bedford’s harbor and then moved to Mexico) – strengthen our own MA Dept of Environmental Protection</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare backup plan</strong> – create with other Blue States a Single-Payer Healthcare system</li>
<li><strong>Restore Net Neutrality</strong> to the FCC</li>
<li><strong>Create a Citizen’s Data Bill of Rights</strong> guaranteeing that <em>your</em> personal and online data belongs to <em>you</em> and not to Comcast (Europeans have had this for years)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-platform-is-really-the-side-show">The platform is really the side-show</h3>
<p>While the platform appears to be the main attraction, anything ironed out like this amounts to so much word salad. Modifying the party’s <a target="_blank" href="https://massdems.org/your-party/party-documents/16-about-your-party/party-documents/151-massachusetts-democratic-party-charter">charter</a> may appear to be a side-show, but it is arguably the more important objective. It turns out the <em>platform</em> is really the side-show.</p>
<p><img src="politburo.jpg" /></p>
<p>Though there will be thousands of delegates and guests at the convention, the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee is the body that actually makes the decisions – think of it as your friendly <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo">Politburo</a>. It’s also a <a target="_blank" href="http://us-campaign-committees.insidegov.com/l/48638/Massachusetts-Democratic-State-Committee">fund-raising</a> machine, so whatever values the platform holds are completely separate from those of the candidates the Committee funds.</p>
<p>The MassDems <a target="_blank" href="https://www.massdems.org/your-party/state-committee">State Committee</a> is the nation’s largest, weighing in at 418 members. Of this number only 80 members are actually voted upon by town delegates. Over 120 have <em>permanent</em> status and cannot be unseated as long as their bodies continue to twitch. Every year the number of these functionaries grows larger.</p>
<p>So let there be no confusion: the platform we are voting upon in two weeks is theirs, not ours. And in the long term, it’s changing the party charter that will actually make the difference.</p>
