<p>Republicans, Republicans, and <em>more</em> Republicans have joined
forces to create a new political party — for Democrats.</p>
<p>This new party, calling itself <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.forwardparty.com/merger_splash?splash=1">Forward</a>,
will initially be chaired by Andrew Yang, who in 2020 posed as a
Democrat for the sake of the primary, and Christine Todd Whitman, a
former Republican governor of New Jersey and EPA Secretary under George
W. Bush.</p>
<p><em>Forward</em> joins forces with two previous GOP attempts to
splinter the centrist wing of the Democratic Party: <a
target="_blank" href="https://renewamericamovement.com/">Renew America</a>, launched in
2021 by a group of Reagan/Bush Republicans; and <a
target="_blank" href="https://joinsam.org/">Serve America</a>, another Republican group
<a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_America_Movement">founded</a>
by Morgan Stanley lawyer Eric Grossman with [George W.] Bush
administration figures.</p>
<p><em>Forward</em> is an idea Christine Todd Whitman has been <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/15/997204597/christine-todd-whitman-pushes-formation-of-alternative-republican-party">pushing</a>
for at least a year, usually by painting Trump’s destruction of the
Republican Party like Jim Jones’ destruction of his own cult.</p>
<p>But rather than simply throwing “rational Republicans” a lifeline,
Whitman’s <em>other</em> goal is to hollow out the Democratic Party by
peeling away as many centrists as possible from the Democratic Party’s
supposed “radical left.” When NPR host Steve Inskeep <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/15/1046279392/rational-republicans-say-some-in-the-party-are-killing-the-gop">asked
Whitman</a> what she wanted from Democrats, she answered: “We want
Democrats, when faced with a radical left candidate from the Democrat
Party, to vote for a centrist Republican.”</p>
<p>Andrew Yang might have run as a Democrat in 2020 but earlier this
month he showed up at a far-right event called <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.freedomfest.com/speakers/andrew-yang/">Freedom Fest
2022</a> to rub elbows with both American and European <a
target="_blank" href="https://freedomfest2022.sched.com/directory/speakers">fascists</a>
and to introduce them to his new project with a talk, “<em>Forward</em>
— Notes on the Future of our Democracy.”</p>
<p>If you were paying any attention to the Republicans’ <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cpachungary.com/en/">CPAC</a> (Conservative Political
Action) Conference in Budapest last May, many of the same elements
attended Freedom Fest 2022. But instead of painting themselves as
“rational Republicans” as they’re now doing with <em>Forward</em>, at
CPAC they were fawning all over Viktor Orban and his <em>Fidesz</em>
party — precisely because of its illiberal policies.</p>
<p><em>Fidesz</em>, which is now a hard right Christian nationalist
party, <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/cpac-hungary">originally</a> started
out as a center-right coalition offering a “big tent” for both
right-leaning liberals and far right nationalists. Over time,
<em>Fidesz</em> has become increasingly repressive, antisemitic, and
fascistic — so much so that last week, after Viktor Orban delivered a
speech warning of the dangers of “race mixing,” one of his long-time
advisors resigned from <em>Fidesz</em>, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/europe/viktor-orban-hungary-race-speech-intl/index.html">slamming</a>
Orban’s remarks as “pure Nazi text worthy of (Nazi propagandist)
Goebbels.”</p>
<p>Whether the Republican Party’s new <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/europe/viktor-orban-hungary-race-speech-intl/index.html">Forward</a>
movement will be an oasis of sanity for “rational Republicans” or a
tasty cheese trap for Democrats who have to compete in Red districts,
<em>Forward</em> is likely to suffer the same fate as <em>Fidesz</em>
because the people and organizations who created <em>Forward</em> are
just as unscrupulous and authoritarian as the orange meanie they created
but can’t control.</p>
<p>If Yang and Whitman’s project goes anywhere — and that’s a big
<em>if</em> — no doubt a number of fickle Democrats would be tempted to
jump ship and join <em>Forward</em>. And good riddance. But if history
offers any sort of guide, the Democratic Party would then try to staunch
the hemorrhaging by moving even further to the right itself, creating an
even more unfriendly climate for progressives.</p>
<p>This is why progressives — presently stuck in the Democratic Party’s
mouse trap — will be forced to leave the Democratic Party sooner or
later. Because America doesn’t need a second centrist party half as much
as it needs one that represents working class people, the poor, and the
marginalized.</p>
