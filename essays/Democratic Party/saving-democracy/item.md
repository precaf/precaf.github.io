Odds-makers, pollsters, and pundits are already calling the election for Clinton. It's hard to see how they are wrong. By even the most conservative models, Hillary Clinton's chances of winning are 60% and she already has her requisite 270 electoral college votes.

But that's not to say the election won't be close. It's going to be a long, long night.

But in the end we will all be safe from too much regulation of the financial industry, single-payer healthcare, shielding college students from crushing debt, or having to rethink American foreign policy -- in short, all the policies that continue to fail us.

Drones will continue to kill civilians in a growing assortment of Middle Eastern countries -- and radicalize them, Saudi Arabia will continue to unload weaponry from US defense contractors, Israel will continue to cash the US checks permitting it to continue to expand its settlements, and Egypt will continue to sentence journalists and dissidents to death.

Police forces will continue to receive military upgrades and spying gear, whistleblowers will continue to be harassed, Justice Department dollars will continue to be spent on programs for the preferential hiring of veterans to police Black neighborhoods. Life for hedge fund managers, tech entrepreneurs and the rest of the meritocracy will continue to be rosy, even as globalism and deregulation suck more and more jobs from less-skilled American workers.

In the years to follow the election, appointments to the Supreme Court will continue to be contentiously opposed, and compromise and accommodation will have citizens wondering where the appointees' loyalties really lie.

In the end, the lumbering financial, military and social apparatus will continue on auto-pilot, no matter which party actually wins.

But throughout the land, on election night in 2016, Democrats (and even a few Republicans) will breathe deep sighs of relief. 

They'll tell themselves: Democracy, or some version of it, has been saved.
