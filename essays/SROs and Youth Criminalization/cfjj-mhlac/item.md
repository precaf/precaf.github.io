As of January 1st, 2021 Massachusetts law on School Resource Officers (SROs) has changed.

In past years the deployment of SRO's [was](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter71/Section37P) entirely up to the Chief of Police. But the choice of whether to place armed police in schools is [now entirely up to school superintendents](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963).

When Governor Baker signed S.2963, the compromise police reform bill, it redefined many elements of the SRO program, striking Section 37P in its entirety, and now gives superintendents the final word on whether they want armed police in district schools:

> "(d) For the purpose of fostering a safe and healthy environment for all students through strategic and appropriate use of law enforcement resources and to achieve positive outcomes for youth and public safety, a chief of police, **at the request of the superintendent** and subject to appropriation, shall assign at least 1 school resource officer to serve the city, town, commonwealth charter school, regional school district or county agricultural school. In the case of a regional school district, commonwealth charter school or county agriculture school, the chief of police of the city or town in which the school is located shall, **at the request of the superintendent**, assign the school resource officer who may be the same officer for all schools in the city or town."

I've attached a PDF of the legislation.

The New Bedford schools, which last October kicked off a community "conversation" with a propaganda video supporting SROs, have now enlisted community members to help improve the program. But instead of improving the optics of their SRO program, the school district now needs to justify its continued existence. And there are two questions the School Superintendent must answer:

1. what risks do [placing armed police in schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BS16uOW5OU) pose to children, particularly children of color?
2. has the police presence in schools actually kept children safe and deterred rampage shootings?

The NAACP New Bedford Branch is sponsoring a [community discussion](https://naacpnewbedford.org/2021/01/sro-12821/) on January 28th from 6-7PM via Zoom which may offer some answers to these questions â€” questions the schools ought to be asking as well. The panel will feature: Leon Smith, Seq., Executive Director of Citizens for Juvenile Justice; Dr. Ricardo Rosa, Co-Chair of New Bedford Coalition to Save Our Schools; Matthew Cregor, Staff Attorney at Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee; and will be moderated by NAACP member Moriah Wiggins.

Everyone is welcome to attend. [Connect via Zoom](https://umassd.zoom.us/j/91641502300?pwd=ZVNLQllkSjJmMlI1aTJHS0w0UHpnUT09) at 6PM on Thursday, January 28th:
