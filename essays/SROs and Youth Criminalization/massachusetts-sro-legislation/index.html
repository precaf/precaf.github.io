<h1 class="title">Massachusetts SRO Legislation</h1>

<p>The 192nd General Court of the Massachusetts Legislature is considering a number of bills related to school resource officers.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2018/Chapter69">Chapter 69 Criminal Justice reforms</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter253">Chapter 253 police reforms</a> now give school superintendents complete discretion to run SRO programs. New legislation also requires schools to collect discipline and arrest data, which for the most part they have failed to do. With school resource officers being advertised by both police departments and school districts as “mentors” and “teachers,” and with even some SROs admitting they are often pressured into being used as disciplinarians by school staff, several new bills make it clear that police in schools are not to replace professional support staff and that their role is solely to deal with clear criminal activity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/HD2534">HD.2534</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/05f9b238-283f-4529-8989-ff7d1bda60a8">Lindsay N. Sabadosa</a> (D-First Hampshire) has proposed HD.2534, An Act relative to the location of school resource officers. This bill removes SROs from school grounds and makes it clear that SROs will never replace school counselors, psychologists, or disciplinarians.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD2043">SD.2043</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/51061aeb-a4a4-470a-9618-4053cae39a48">Harriet L. Chandler</a> (D-First Worcester) has proposed SD.2043, An Act relative to safer schools. This bill makes it clear that SROs will not (i) serve as school disciplinarians, enforcers of school regulations or in place of licensed school psychologists, psychiatrists or counselors; and (ii) use police powers to address traditional school discipline issues, including non-violent disruptive behavior. The bill also prohibits SROs from intervening in all but clearly criminal acts.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/HD3090">HD.3090</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/61a670a7-37a6-42f0-8c8f-4cfc1d93693a">Kay Khan</a> (D-11th Middlesex) has proposed HD.3090, An Act relative to safer schools. This bill makes it clear that SROs will not (i) serve as school disciplinarians, enforcers of school regulations or in place of licensed school psychologists, psychiatrists or counselors; and (ii) use police powers to address traditional school discipline issues, including non-violent disruptive behavior. The bill also prohibits SROs from intervening in all but clearly criminal acts.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD180">SD.180</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/4988891a-7204-4880-8f5f-776861f75b94">Sonia Chang-Diaz</a> (D-Second Suffolk) has proposed SD.180, An Act to prioritize violence prevention and social emotional health in school support staff hiring. In the event that schools keep SROs, it should not be at the expense of professional support staff. This bill requires at least seven “Mental and social emotional health support personnel” for every SRO and requires DESE to document compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/HD2748">HD.2748</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/BFO1/192">Brandy Fluker Oakley</a> (D-12th Suffolk) has proposed HD.2748, An Act to prioritize violence prevention and social emotional health in school support staff hiring. In the event that schools keep SROs, it should not be at the expense of professional support staff. This bill requires at least seven “Mental and social emotional health support personnel” for every SRO and requires DESE to document compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Republicans didn’t care much for the <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2018/Chapter69">Chapter 69 Criminal Justice reforms</a> passed in 2018 and no sooner did the <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter253">Chapter 253 police reforms</a> go into effect on January 1st than they began devising ways to return to the good old days when police controlled school hallways, not superintendents.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD856">SD.856</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/493988da-4de8-49a0-8d6c-090097e89920">Patrick M. O’Connor</a> (R-Plymouth and Norfolk) has proposed SD.856, An Act Creating a School Resource Officer Grant Program and Fund. This bill establishes a state-administered fund to be shared only with communities who adopt SRO programs, and funds must be matched by local communities. The Commissioner of Public Safety (a political appointment) appears to exert significant influence in grant awards.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD857">SD.857</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/493988da-4de8-49a0-8d6c-090097e89920">Patrick M. O’Connor</a> (R-Plymouth and Norfolk) has proposed SD.857, An Act promoting local control and effective training of school resource officers. This bill returns appointments of SROs exclusively to police chiefs, despite the title’s claim to restore community control.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD2171">SD.2171</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/429f87cf-f7a1-4201-ade4-9efeb9149d03">Bruce E. Tarr</a> (R-First Essex and Middlesex) has proposed SD.2171, An Act relative to school safety issues. This bill replaces superintendent’s discretionary appointment of SROs with an appointment by the Commissioner of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional bills with SRO provisions from James Arciero and Walter Timilty seem to be cases of Democrats pandering to the police lobby. A third stange bill from Cynthia Creem is sure to offer both opponents of SROs and opponents of gun control something to jointly despise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/HD2052">HD.2052</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/70e42c78-89e1-43cb-bc65-7d0da132daa2">James Arciero</a> (D-2nd Middlesex) has proposed HD.2052, Resolve establishing an Enhanced Public School Safety Commission. This resolution would create a commission to study placing bulletproof glass, classroom surveillance, and retired police officers in schools.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD769">SD.769</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/0db5ab85-b9c0-4b48-a0b4-d5944bab0a2d">Walter F. Timilty</a> (D-Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth) has proposed SD.769, An Act relative to school safety and security. This bill involves school resource officers in a requirement to hold live intruder drills within 90 days of the beginning of the school year.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD1506">SD.1506</a> - <a target="_blank" href="https://scorecard.progressivemass.com/legislator/ece82669-b6f6-4f0f-ae5d-7b238b1cd1dd">Cynthia Stone Creem</a> (D-1st Middlesex and Norfolk) has proposed SD.1506, An Act relative to firearms and firearms violence. This bill sets up a Firearms Violence Prevention Trust Fund, which among other things, prioritizes “programs that support the provision of school resource officers.” Revenue for the fund comes from a 4.5% tax on guns and ammunition sales.</p></li>
