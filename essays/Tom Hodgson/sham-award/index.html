<p>On June 2nd Tom Hodgson, along with 69 others chosen from 365 nominations, received the National Sheriff’s Association’s (NSA’s) “National Command &amp; Staff College” <a target="_blank" href="http://commandcollege.org/national-sheriffs-award/">Magnus award</a> for “building and maintaining trusting community relationships.” Hodgson’s award leaves many of us scratching our heads wondering how high suicide rates, recidivism, and abuse of inmates merit an award with a description like this.</p>
<p>But a quick look at a few of the numerous recipients hints at the National Sheriff’s Association’s increasingly Trump-oriented and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/12/politics/jeff-sessions-anglo-american-law-enforcement/index.html">racist political agenda</a> — which has nothing to do with public safety, respect for campaign law, treating inmates and the public fairly, or earning the public trust. While citizens keep asking — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-bad-sherriffs.html">Why are there so many bad sheriffs?</a> — the National Sheriff’s Association doles out sham awards to scofflaws and bigots — claiming that such men are the “best of law enforcement.”</p>

<p>We don’t think misconduct like the following should have earned any of these “award-winners” anything but scorn or jail time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ron Abernathy</strong>, from Alabama’s Tuscaloosa County, had a wrongful death problem at his jail and wants to deal with it by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.waaytv.com/content/news/Sheriff-Lawsuit-possible-over-social-media-comments--482848341.html">suing his critics</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The County Commission was not happy with overcrowding at the jail run by Jefferson County Alabama Sheriff (and NSA Board and Executive Committee member) <strong>Mike Hale</strong> and suggested that 300-500 low-level offenders might have to be released. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/12/jefferson_county_sheriff_mike_7.html">Hale said he didn’t care</a>: overcrowding be damned, inmates weren’t going anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grady Judd</strong>, Sheriff in Polk County, Florida, is an open-carry, <em>arm-every-teacher</em> advocate known for his fondness for grandstanding. Judd was sued last year for conducting <a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lawsuit-filed-against-polk-county-233400932.html">unconstitutional identity checks</a> at emergency evacuation shelters during Hurricane Irma.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>John Layton</strong>, Marion County, Indiana sheriff, is no stranger to controversy. The Indianapolis City Council authorized a quarter million dollar <a target="_blank" href="https://cbs4indy.com/2018/06/06/council-committee-approves-audit-of-marion-county-sheriffs-office/">audit</a> of the Sheriff’s Office by KPMG. His son, also a veteran Indianapolis police officer, was arrested for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/sheriffs-son-an-impd-cop-arrested-for-drug-dealing">dealing cocaine</a> in 2016. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Citizens-Against-Marion-County-Sheriff-John-Layton-498461360268823/">Citizens Against Marion County Sheriff John Layton</a> has compiled a long list of questions and grievances. Apparently Sheriff Layton is not doing such a great job “building and maintaining trusting community relationships.”</p></li>
<li><p>In Hendricks County, Indiana, Sheriff <strong>Brett Clark</strong> replaced in-person jail visits with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.homewav.com/jail-video-visits-get-positive-feedback/">HomeWav</a>, a video visitation service like Securus. Even when family members visit inmates at Clark’s jail, they can see one another only through a video screen, not directly.</p></li>
<li><p>We were relieved that <strong>Louis Ackal</strong>, head of Louisiana’s Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Department and subject of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV5WMCmwHqc">Fault Lines documentary</a> (along with Hodgson) on jail abuses, didn’t go home with a Magnus Award. Ackal, who piled up civil rights and wrongful death lawsuits, charges of killing a handcuffed man, using excessive force on pregnant women, planting evidence, racism, corruption, <a target="_blank" href="http://forward.com/news/344302/louisiana-sheriff-in-jew-bastard-rant-faces-recall-push/">calling a federal prosecutor</a> a “son-of-a-bitch Jew bastard,” famously opined that <a target="_blank" href="http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/11/03/louisiana-sheriffs-view-on-black-people-they-needed-to-be-treated-like-animals/">black people</a> “needed to be treated like animals.” What a relief the National Sheriff’s Association has <em>some</em> standards, albeit low ones.</p></li>

<p>But elsewhere in Louisiana the Magnum award winners were at it — abusing their communities’ trust and pocketbooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Charles Parish, Louisiana, Sheriff <strong>Greg Champagne</strong>, and <strong>National Sheriffs’ Association president</strong> (pictured above at the 2018 NSA convention with FOX News’ Jeanine Pirro), took some of his deputies to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_6be22a46-f0a3-11e7-8485-b37d944462a0.html">Standing Rock</a> in North Dakota to “observe” the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, allegedly on the public dime and ostensibly to curry favor with the petrochemical industry. The Center for Constitutional Rights <a target="_blank" href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/human-rights-attorneys-sue-louisiana-sheriff-records-related-0">sued for travel documents</a> after filing public information requests and not getting them.</li>
<li>In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Sheriff <strong>Joseph P. Lopinto III</strong>’s deputies were accused of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/us/keeven-robinson-death-police-louisiana.html">excessive force</a> in the death of Keveen Robinson in May. Lopinto, handpicked by Newell Normand to succeed him in July 2017, made it clear there would be few changes from Normand, including ongoing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/crime_police/article_5cddbe1a-24a7-11e8-b591-872dd96b2d83.html">friction with the Latino community</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing around the country, the Magnus awards reflected more of the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hennepin County, Minnesota Sheriff <strong>Richard Stanek</strong> served on the National Sheriff’s Association board of directors and in 2012 was the chair of Minnesota’s Homeland Security Committee. In 2012 Stanek testified before Congress about <a target="_blank" href="http://judiciary.house.gov/_files/hearings/Hearings%202012/Stanek%2007252012.pdf">Somali gangs</a> <em>he claimed</em> had an astounding 125,000 members in Minnesota, the majority in Hennepin county. Stanek was one of 10 anti-immigrant sheriffs to <a target="_blank" href="http://kstp.com/news/hennepin-county-sheriff-richard-stanek-white-house-president-trump/4787170/">meet with Trump</a> last month at the White House.</li>
<li>Anoka County, Minnesota Sheriff (and NSA Board member) <strong>James Stuart</strong> is being <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gopusa.com/aclu-sues-county-authorities-for-turning-illegal-alien-over-to-ice/">sued by the ACLU</a> for violating the rights of an undocumented woman who was illegally detained for ICE. Just like Tom Hodgson.</li>
<li>Dechutes County, Oregon Sheriff <strong>Shane Nelson</strong>’s employees are the focus of several <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-deschutes-sheriffs-office-investigations/">external investigations</a> of misconduct by a public servant and firearms violations. One of his captains was indicted for embezzling public funds, and Nelson himself is the subject of two additional complaints. Nelson also allegedly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uniondemocrat.com/newsroomstafflist/4713822-151/deschutes-sheriffs-candidate-alleges-harassment">harassed deputy Eric Kozowski</a>, an employee who announced he was challenging Nelson in the sheriff’s race.</li>
<li>In Texas, Rockwall County Sheriff <strong>Harold Eavenson</strong> recently signed a 287(g) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roysecityheraldbanner.com/news/sheriff-defends-stance-on-ice-policies/article_5800ae14-fb05-11e7-97b0-a3686a539c03.html">agreement with ICE</a>, and met with Trump to complain about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/07/well-destroy-his-career-trump-quips-about-a-texas-state-senator-at-odds-with-a-county-sheriff/">state legislation</a> he claimed would help Mexican cartels. Eavenson was angry when the U.S. Sentencing Commission <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/11/biggest-sham-sheriffs-outraged-at-federal-release-6000-inmates-skeptical-about.html">reduced the sentences</a> for 6,000 lower-level drug offenses, and both he and the National Sheriff’s Association blamed it on “the Obama administration’s attitude toward law enforcement.”</li>
<li><strong>Michael D. Chapman</strong>, Magnus winner from Loudoun County, Virginia, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/special-prosecutor-appointed-to-investigate-loudoun-sheriff/2015/09/15/2c27a7fa-57d5-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html?utm_term=.8df53ae10add">investigated in 2015</a> because he had allegedly “illegally obtained and published private e-mails of his Republican primary opponent and that he has illegally concealed the true source of campaign donations in his run for reelection.” In what Bristol County residents will recognize as a familiar defense, Chapman called the allegations politically-motivated “nonsense.” A fired detective sued Chapman for <a target="_blank" href="http://loudounnow.com/2017/07/25/fired-detective-sues-sheriff-for-intimidation-retaliation-wrongful-termination/">intimidation</a>, Chapman also <a target="_blank" href="http://thebullelephant.com/loudoun-sheriff-mike-chapman-featured-in-immigration-reform-video/">made a video for FAIR</a>, an anti-immigrant hate group.</li>
<li>Like Tom Hodgson, Spokane County, Washington’s <strong>Ozzie Knezovich</strong> is a man drawn to simple answers for complex problems. In 2017 he blamed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/sep/14/spokane-county-sheriff-breakdown-of-society-media-/">school shootings</a> on the media, bad child-rearing — everything but the ease with which guns can be acquired. Knezovich was charged with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/browse/cases/6594">violations of campaign laws</a> for using his employees as props in campaign ads. Knezovich, like Hodgson, blamed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/mar/06/knezovich-stands-behind-heated-comments-blaming-ob/">Barak Obama</a> for a supposed “war on cops.”</li>
<li>Sheriff <strong>Eric Severson</strong>, Waukesha County, Wisconsin, signed onto a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/30/waukesha-county-sheriff-eric-severson-defends-immigration-program-prepares-march/561430002/">287(g) program with ICE</a>, despite calls from over <a target="_blank" href="https://fox6now.com/2018/04/30/voces-de-la-frontera-to-march-in-waukesha-on-a-day-without-latinos-to-protest-immigration-enforcement/">10,000 members of his community</a> to refrain from doing so. So much for “building and maintaining trusting community relationships.”</li>
