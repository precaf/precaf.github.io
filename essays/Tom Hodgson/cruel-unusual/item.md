In a front-page piece by Curt Brown (“Mentally ill inmates sue Sheriff Hodgson”) in today’s print version of the [Standard Times](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20180110/mentally-ill-inmates-sue-sheriff-hodgson-over-solitary-confinement), Bristol County Sheriff Hodgson disputes charges in a [lawsuit](Lawsuit-Prisoner-Services.pdf) brought against him — allegations similar to those BCCJ heard from former inmates whom we interviewed:

“It’s a frivolous lawsuit,” Hodgson told the Standard-Times. The sheriff also questioned the timing of the suit since the state legislature is now considering a sweeping criminal justice reform package.

Hodgson claims his facility has “never received a deficiency on any inspection of its mental or physical health care” and that “the Bristol County House of Corrections ranks in the top 10 percent of all correctional facilities in the nation.”

That's *not* for quality — but it’s certainly in the top 10 percent of county [prison suicides](https://news.wgbh.org/2017/05/08/news/why-suicide-rate-bristol-county-jails-so-high).

But Tom Hodgson didn’t acknowledge that he’s lost a number of suits for abusive treatment of prisoners. In 2009, for instance, the sheriff was accused of housing prisoners in cruel and unusual conditions — and he [lost the case](http://www.heraldnews.com/article/20091020/News/310209121). 

If Hodgson's weasel words are true — that inspections do not reveal deficiencies related to abuse — then the state had better start conducting thorough inspections.

For the sheriff a good defense requires dispensing with facts of public record. “The lawsuit is full of misinformation and flat-out lies,” spokesman Jonathan Darling told the Standard Times. “Shame on Prisoner Legal Services for filing such a ridiculous lawsuit and wasting taxpayer resources.”

Yet it’s hardly “ridiculous” when Hodgson has a history of abusing prisoners. And the sheriff wasn't worrying about waste when he squandered millions of dollars in taxpayer resources pursuing a losing case [all the way to the Supreme Court](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20100620/news/6200338). In fact, wasting taxpayer money — like the suicides in his jails — stand out among Massachusetts county jails. Which is why we are asking for thorough investigations.
