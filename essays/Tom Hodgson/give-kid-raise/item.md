The New Bedford waterfront has its share of crime, including organized crime. [Carlos Rafael](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/16/bristol-sheriff-captain-convicted-codfather-case/oaCkEkrlayZciUVZXdjVzK/story.html), *aka* the "Codfather," served time in federal prison on numerous charges,  including money laundering. Though no criminal connection has been  established between Rafael and Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson,  two of Hodgson's officers were convicted of using a Thanksgiving turkey  airlift to the Azores (for repatriated deportees) as an opportunity to  illegally transfer money offshore for Rafael. The money was carefully  divided among couriers (so as not to raise suspicions) and was then  recombined and deposited into the "Codfather's" accounts.

[James Melo](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/former-captain-bristol-county-sheriff-s-office-sentenced-smuggling-profits-portugal), a captain with the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office, was convicted in  Federal court of "conspiracy to commit offenses against the United  States and one count of structuring the export of monetary instruments." Melo got a mild slap on the wrist: twelve months of probation. Sheriffs Deputy [Antonio Freitas](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/sheriff-s-deputy-convicted-scheme-smuggle-illegal-fishing-profits-abroad) was slightly less lucky. Freitas, who also served as a deputized ICE  agent for Hodgson, was convicted of charges similar to Melo's but served twelve months in prison.

There is a [fascinating account](http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/17-2092P-01A.pdf) of Rafael's money-laundering and the role Freitas played in it buried  in an appeal from federal prosecutors Mark T. Quinlivan and Trump  appointee Andrew E. Lelling. In the document, Rafael boasted of his  close relationship with Hodgson and the influence it played in obtaining both a job and a raise for Freitas:

> "I got him the job, I got him the raises, so he'll do what the fuck I tell him to  do. He called me. He says, 'what the fuck is going on, everybody got a  promotion in this fuckin' place but me.' So I'm like this [gestures]  with the sheriff. I called the Sheriff and I said 'what the fuck are you doing to me Tom? Fuckin Freitas has been there for so many fuckin'  years, you're not going to give him a fuckin' promotion and a raise?'  'Jesus Carlos, we do not have enough money in the budget.' I said fuck  off, find a way, give the kid a raise. He got his promotion, right, so  he called me and said I want to thank you very much, I finally got my  fuckin' promotion and my raise. So it's nice to know people."

Rafael's claim that Hodgson had assisted Freitas was [confirmed by Freitas himself](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/17-2092/17-2092-2018-09-06.pdf?ts=1536267607), who admitted to Federal investigators "that he had carried money for  Rafael in the past because Rafael had helped him get a promotion [from  Hodgson] and had co-signed a home improvement loan for him."

When Hodgson was called to the witness stand during Freitas' trial, "Hodgson remembered Rafael saying over the phone that he needed a promotion. But Rafael's call did not influence his decision, Hodgson stressed."  Incredibly — as in "I don't believe a damn word of it" — Quinlivan and  Lelling simply took Hodgson's word that he had granted the favor  because, well, he was going to do it *anyway*.

But Rafael had access to the sheriff and knew that Freitas "worked on  customs with the immigration unit of the Sheriff's Department. And  Rafael said that Freitas could also help the co-conspirators get their  cash out of the country by bypassing airport security." This is because  Freitas had received the requested promotion to deputized ICE agent at  the jail and had "completed a multiday training program for ICE officers that covered (among other topics) financial crimes, including  structuring and bulk-cash smuggling — an instructor, for example, told  attendees that structuring involved "having more than $10,000 in cash  and breaking it into smaller amounts to conduct financial transactions  in order to avoid the reporting requirements."

Freitas was not only well-positioned to launder money for Rafael, but perfectly trained to commit the crime.

All thanks to Tom Hodgson.
