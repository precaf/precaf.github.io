<p>The New Bedford waterfront has its share of crime, including
organized crime. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/16/bristol-sheriff-captain-convicted-codfather-case/oaCkEkrlayZciUVZXdjVzK/story.html">Carlos
Rafael</a>, <em>aka</em> the “Codfather,” served time in federal prison
on numerous charges, including money laundering. Though no criminal
connection has been established between Rafael and Bristol County
Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, two of Hodgson’s officers were convicted of
using a Thanksgiving turkey airlift to the Azores (for repatriated
deportees) as an opportunity to illegally transfer money offshore for
Rafael. The money was carefully divided among couriers (so as not to
raise suspicions) and was then recombined and deposited into the
“Codfather’s” accounts.</p>
<p><a

Melo</a>, a captain with the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office, was
convicted in Federal court of “conspiracy to commit offenses against the
United States and one count of structuring the export of monetary
instruments.” Melo got a mild slap on the wrist: twelve months of
probation. Sheriffs Deputy <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/sheriff-s-deputy-convicted-scheme-smuggle-illegal-fishing-profits-abroad">Antonio
Freitas</a> was slightly less lucky. Freitas, who also served as a
deputized ICE agent for Hodgson, was convicted of charges similar to
Melo’s but served twelve months in prison.</p>
<p>There is a <a
target="_blank" href="http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/17-2092P-01A.pdf">fascinating
account</a> of Rafael’s money-laundering and the role Freitas played in
it buried in an appeal from federal prosecutors Mark T. Quinlivan and
Trump appointee Andrew E. Lelling. In the document, Rafael boasted of
his close relationship with Hodgson and the influence it played in
obtaining both a job and a raise for Freitas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I got him the job, I got him the raises, so he’ll do what the fuck I
tell him to do. He called me. He says, ‘what the fuck is going on,
everybody got a promotion in this fuckin’ place but me.’ So I’m like
this [gestures] with the sheriff. I called the Sheriff and I said ‘what
the fuck are you doing to me Tom? Fuckin Freitas has been there for so
many fuckin’ years, you’re not going to give him a fuckin’ promotion and
a raise?’ ‘Jesus Carlos, we do not have enough money in the budget.’ I
said fuck off, find a way, give the kid a raise. He got his promotion,
right, so he called me and said I want to thank you very much, I finally
got my fuckin’ promotion and my raise. So it’s nice to know people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rafael’s claim that Hodgson had assisted Freitas was <a
target="_blank" href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/17-2092/17-2092-2018-09-06.pdf?ts=1536267607">confirmed
by Freitas himself</a>, who admitted to Federal investigators “that he
had carried money for Rafael in the past because Rafael had helped him
get a promotion [from Hodgson] and had co-signed a home improvement loan
for him.”</p>
<p>When Hodgson was called to the witness stand during Freitas’ trial,
“Hodgson remembered Rafael saying over the phone that he needed a
promotion. But Rafael’s call did not influence his decision, Hodgson
stressed.” Incredibly — as in “I don’t believe a damn word of it” —
Quinlivan and Lelling simply took Hodgson’s word that he had granted the
favor because, well, he was going to do it <em>anyway</em>.</p>
<p>But Rafael had access to the sheriff and knew that Freitas “worked on
customs with the immigration unit of the Sheriff’s Department. And
Rafael said that Freitas could also help the co-conspirators get their
cash out of the country by bypassing airport security.” This is because
Freitas had received the requested promotion to deputized ICE agent at
the jail and had “completed a multiday training program for ICE officers
that covered (among other topics) financial crimes, including
structuring and bulk-cash smuggling — an instructor, for example, told
attendees that structuring involved”having more than $10,000 in cash and
breaking it into smaller amounts to conduct financial transactions in
order to avoid the reporting requirements.”</p>
<p>Freitas was not only well-positioned to launder money for Rafael, but
perfectly trained to commit the crime.</p>
<p>All thanks to Tom Hodgson.</p>
