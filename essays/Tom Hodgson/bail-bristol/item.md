The [Mass Bail Fund](https://www.massbailfund.org/) is looking for [additional volunteers](/Tom Hodgson/bail-fund/) to post bail for prisoners at the Bristol County jail. There will be a meeting in Dartmouth in November for those with time to give. Posting bail is the perfect volunteer gig for people with some privilege to put to good use. [Email](mailto:bristol.county.justice@gmail.com) us if you're interested.

The Mass Bail Fund doesn't post bail of more than \$500. A substantial percentage of those in county jails have not been convicted of a crime but cannot meet even a small bail amount. Click [here](https://www.massbailfund.org/how-it-works.html) for more information on how the Bail Fund works â€” *but here's the short version*. You'll get a call at an inconvenient hour. And when you show up to bail out your client, the Bristol County Jail will make you jump through more hoops than most; you'll have to wait, come back later, or go to a different location. You'll front the money for the Bail Fund, drive the client off the jail premises, and get your money back from the Bail Fund in roughly a week.

Anybody is welcome to volunteer, but if you're older, whiter and a member of a religious organization you will magically get better results for your client. You'll be doing your part to reduce mass-incarceration right in your own community.

Consider this. The [inability to post bail](https://beyondthebillable.bbablogs.org/2019/06/18/massachusetts-bail-fund-seeks-to-end-pre-trial-incarceration-by-providing-resources-for-court-appointed-counsel-and-their-clients/) can make a prisoner:

- more likely to lose their children to DSS
- more likely to lose their job, plunging their family deeper into poverty
- more likely to plead guilty just to get out of abusive conditions
- more likely to receive harsher sentences because of the inability to easily access legal resources
- more likely to be found guilty
