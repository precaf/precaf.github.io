<p>In Massachusetts, sheriffs and deputies are <em>law enforcement</em>
officers with limited powers who may <em>assist</em> genuine police
officers when requested. But they are not <em>police officers</em>.
Sheriffs run jails, transport prisoners, serve eviction and other
notices, and are prohibited from patrolling cities and towns — which are
chartered (through state laws) to appoint and hire police officers with
<em>full</em> police powers (a crucial point mentioned shortly).
Sheriffs, however, <em>do</em> enjoy a few limited <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleII/Chapter279/Section38">police-like</a></em><a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleII/Chapter279/Section38">powers</a>;
for example, while they are transporting prisoners through a foreign
jurisdiction or <em>when asked</em> to assist in quelling a riot. And
that’s about it.</p>
<p>But like Hershel Walker, Bristol County’s Sheriff Thomas Hodgson
keeps trying to pass himself off as the police — and whenever Hodgson’s
tried it, it’s either been unappreciated or he’s failed at it. Hodgson
<em>implies</em> he has police powers by claiming to be tough on crime,
but since he has very limited police-like powers all he can
<em>really</em> do is suggest that women carry pepper spray, hand out
swag to seniors at “safety” talks, lend out canines, and have his jail
officers pose with children and his $250K “Homeland Security” command
truck at parades.</p>
<p>It may seem like a trivial matter to Hodgson, but democracies require
both the consent of the people to be governed — and to be policed. Only
law enforcement officers elected or appointed by chartered Massachusetts
municipalities have the <em>police</em> powers that Hodgson has
repeatedly, and illegally, attempted to usurp.</p>
<p><img src="mantra.jpg" /> <em>But don’t expect to see Sheriff Hodgson
show up when you call 911</em></p>
<p>In November 2003, Hodgson (without being asked, and even
<em>after</em> being asked to stop) decided that New Bedford’s police
force wasn’t doing a good-enough job. So he began sending his officers
to patrol the city’s streets. The New Bedford Police Chief was not
amused, nor the mayor, and neither was the District Attorney. <a
target="_blank" href="https://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/09/26/city_county_sheriff_in_turf_tussle/">The
Standard-Times</a> reported, “Bristol District Attorney Paul F. Walsh
[…] said Hodgson has made no effort to coordinate with city police and
has a track record of legal failures when investigating crimes inside
his own facilities. Walsh also said that arrests made by the sheriff’s
deputies, who typically serve warrants and act as guards at the county
jail, would be subject to challenges in court. ‘You can’t have the guy
who was serving mashed potatoes to inmates last week calling himself a
drug detective this week,’ Walsh said.”</p>
<p>But that’s <em>exactly</em> Hodgson’s <em>shtick</em> — playing cop —
and he’s been doing it throughout his entire time in office.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 2005 Peter Larkin was Hodgson’s “Detective
Lieutenant of Internal Affairs.” Larkin resigned from the Bristol County
Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) three years after <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/story/news/2002/11/22/deputies-criticized-as-case-unravels/50453290007/">botching</a>
a drug investigation the BCSO undertook — <em>again</em> without
“assistance from other police agencies.” One lawyer described the low
quality of BCSO investigators, “They’re not trained for investigative
work,” while another <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/story/news/2002/10/09/fbi-mello-set-bounty-on/52942286007/">called
the BCSO</a> itself “a task force of goofballs who couldn’t cut it as
real cops.”</p>
<p>ABC6 News <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.abc6.com/former-new-bedford-public-school-employee-fired-over-comments-made-on-social-media/">reported</a>
in July 2020 that Larkin, who eventually found work as an attendance
officer with the New Bedford Public Schools, had been fired (again) from
<em>that</em> job for advocating <em>lynching</em> Black Lives Matter
protesters: “I would roll tanks and bulldozers. Mush any human in the
way. Shoot everyone else. Pile up the bodies and burn them on national
tv.” Within days Larkin had to <a
target="_blank" href="https://wbsm.com/report-new-bedford-public-school-staffer-resigns-following-facebook-post/">resign</a>.
This news was no surprise given Hodgson’s membership in a hate group and
memberships in several extremist organizations.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2017 the State Judicial Court, the “Supreme Court” of
Massachusetts, considered the legality of a sheriff calling himself a
police officer, and drew a clear distinction between <em>law enforcement
officer</em> and <em>police officer</em> in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/inmaco20170112199">Commonwealth v.
Gernrich</a> where it concluded that “sheriff’s deputies are
<em>not</em> police officers.”</p>
<p><img src="sjc.jpg" /></p>
<p>The SJC had to consider the case of an inmate in the Worcester County
jail who had lied to a deputy and was charged with violating <a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter269/Section13A">G.
L. c. 269, § 13A</a>, which reads, “Whoever intentionally and knowingly
makes or causes to be made a false report of a crime to <em>police
officers</em> shall be punished by…” The inmate disputed that the
<em>deputy</em> he had lied to was a <em>police officer</em>, so the
matter before the SJC was the “issue whether a deputy sheriff is a
police officer within the meaning of G. L. c. 269, § 13A, present[ing] a
question of statutory interpretation…” The Justices reviewed
Massachusetts law and concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the reasons explained above, <em>a deputy sheriff is not a
‘police officer’</em> for purposes of G. L. c. 269, § 13A. Thus, we
reverse the defendant’s conviction, and a judgment of not guilty shall
enter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasoning behind the ruling is critical. The Justices wrote that
G. L. c. 41, § 98 defines “unique” police powers that other law
enforcement officials lack; therefore only <em>police</em> can be called
<em>police</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the term “police officer” appears in a variety of statutory
contexts, we adopt the definition in <a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter41/Section98">G.
L. c. 41, § 98</a>, to guide our analysis of the issue. <em>General Laws
c. 41, § 98</em>, which authorizes the appointment of “police officers”
for cities and towns, is an appropriate guide for the interpretation of
<a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter269/Section13A">G.
L. c. 269, § 13A</a>, because it permits a distinction between the broad
class of law enforcement officers empowered to perform only certain
police duties and those expressly designated as “police officers”
without such limitations. The definition of police officer in G. L.
c. 41, § 98, encompasses a broad range of authority, including the power
to make warrantless arrests, <em>that is unique</em> within the class of
law enforcement officers. <em>In other words, a police officer is a law
enforcement officer, but not all law enforcement officers are police
officers.</em> It is this broad authority, <em>granted only to persons
appointed as police officers by cities and towns</em>, that defines the
term for the purposes of G. L. c. 269, § 13A.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bottom line: “a deputy sheriff is <em>not</em> a police officer.”
You’d think that a ruling so clear and from the highest court in the
state would stop Hodgson from trying to impersonate a cop.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>Barely three months following the SCJ ruling, the Fall River <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.heraldnews.com/story/news/politics/county/2017/04/20/correia-s-plan-to-increase/21336722007/">Herald
News</a> reported that Hodgson and disgraced former mayor (and now
incarcerated felon) Jaziel Correia had entered into a backroom deal to
have Hodgson run Fall River’s police lockup. Hodgson had tried and
failed to sell a similar scheme before when Deval Patrick was governor.
This time around Hodgson enlisted the help of a con man. The now
incarcerated former mayor swore up and down that two local state
representatives had promised to find state funding for Hodgson.</p>
<p>There were just two problems with the Correia-Hodgson deal. The Fall
River police reminded all parties that policing by sheriffs was
<em>illegal</em>. And Carole Fiola, who served on the Joint Ways and
Means Committee and whose name Correira dropped, had to set the record
straight when she told the Herald: “It was the first time I heard about
it and I am not aware there is a budget request.”</p>
<p>The scheme was both illegal and based on lies.</p>
<p>Classic Hodgson.</p>
