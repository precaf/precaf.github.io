*Paul Heroux at the State House*

Not only in Bristol County, but all over the United States, sheriffs are on the ballot. Given the previous administration's love affair with [Anglo-American sheriffs](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/12/politics/jeff-sessions-anglo-american-law-enforcement/index.html), America is now paying a bit more attention to these races than ever before.

In Massachusetts sheriffs have extremely attenuated powers but extremely long terms — rivaling that of a U.S. Senator — and very little accountability — all of which affords them a lot of time and opportunity to get into mischief.

By now everyone knows about Bristol County's *Angry White Man* sheriff — the community college dropout who has been running our jail by the seat of his pants while making frequent trips to the border with militia members and white supremacists. *Not to mention* letting an indecent number of people die by [suicide](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/14/inmate-apparent-suicide-bristol-county-jail-renews-concerns-about-sheriff/TuNg7IXb71nb5XNBQFmWuL/story.html) while half-starving inmates and gouging their families with [usurious](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/charging-for-prison-phone-calls-burdens-families/ar-AAQgq4a) phone charges.

Tom Hodgson is like your neighbor, the do-it-yourself plumber, who broke the toilet, flooded the first floor, and left sewage all over. Now cooler heads have to call someone with professional skills — somebody who actually knows what the hell he's doing — to fix the mess the stubborn hubby has made.

And [Paul Heroux](https://www.paulheroux.org/) is just the guy to do it. Heroux has a bachelor's in psychology, a master's in corrections, has worked in corrections *doing* corrections, and has been running a city government with a budget three times larger than Hodgson's.

In the process Heroux has also managed to steer clear of the state [auditor](https://www.mass.gov/doc/an-audit-of-the-bristol-county-sheriffs-office/download), the [state attorney general](https://media.wbur.org/wp/2020/12/EMBARGOED-UNTIL-1230-PM-12.15.20-AGO-Report-into-BCSO-Response-to-May-1-Disturbance-2020-12-15.pdf), and the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/20/ice-close-two-detention-centers) — unlike the incumbent clown who couldn't document a third of his expenses to the auditor's satisfaction, misplaced ICE payments in one of a dozen slush funds he keeps, who has systematically violated the civil rights of his prisoners, and last year lost his prized 287(g) program because of gross incompetence and cruelty — cruelty borne out of pandering to and offering Republican voters angry red meat.

Paul Heroux, who sometimes comes across as a brainy technocrat and not a movie-goer's image of a Western sheriff, is nevertheless unlikely to [jet](https://www.heraldnews.com/story/news/2014/07/16/bristol-county-sheriff-visiting-texas/36839473007/) down to the Texas ranch of [militia members](https://bccjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vickers-ranch.html) at taxpayer expense to play dress-up with Western sheriffs, take time off to run the Massachusetts [Trump campaign](https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/11/21/thomas-hodgson-trump-support-immigration), pose on the Capitol steps with Ted Cruz, Louis Gohmert, or various extremist and [anti-government groups](https://www.azmirror.com/2022/10/21/arizona-ground-zero-for-extremist-anti-government-constitutional-sheriffs-movement/) he belongs to, or sit on the [national advisory board](https://www.fairus.org/about-fair/board-directors) of a hate group — like the incumbent.

Heroux's not going to put inmates in [chain gangs](https://www.thesunchronicle.com/sheriff-defends-chain-gangs/article_d41ab89d-c8f4-5c7d-b8f0-c35ce31debde.html), try to [circumvent](https://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/09/26/city_county_sheriff_in_turf_tussle/) laws that keep Massachusetts sheriffs from doing police work, try to [make deals](https://www.heraldnews.com/story/news/politics/county/2017/04/20/correia-s-plan-to-increase/21336722007/) with a Fall River mayor now serving time in federal prison, [do favors](http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/17-2092P-01A.pdf) for a New Bedford waterfront crime boss, or [break federal law](https://www.heraldnews.com/story/news/crime/2015/09/10/military-review-bristol-county-sheriff/33560041007/) by deputizing military recruiters (which earned Hodgson a visit from Navy investigators). And no multi-million dollar [legal appeals](https://www.masscops.com/threads/hodgson-loses-another-appeal-of-civil-rights-lawsuit.57819/) for lost cases that would never have been heard if the incumbent hadn't broken laws by [violating the rights](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/12/15/healey-hodgson-bristol-immigration-detainees-report) of inmates or his employees.

No, it's going to be the sound of *crickets* again when Heroux is elected sheriff.

Besides not racking up massive legal bills paid for by taxpayers for grandstanding and law-breaking, Heroux is also not going to write "love letters" to racists like [Stephen Miller](https://hodgsonemails.wordpress.com/), Trump's evil genius immigration advisor, or [rat out his own church](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/12/05/thomas-hodgson-stephen-miller/) like Hodgson did for the "crime" of his parish caring for undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers. For a guy who likes to remind his Trumpy base how "Christian" he is, Hodgson sure seems to have forgotten Exodus 22:21: "You shall not oppress or mistreat a stranger, for you were strangers in Egypt." Like everything about Hodgson the *poseur*, even his piety is all show.

But the million-dollar question is — do voters want an aggressive grandstander who just won't stay in his lane and do his damn job — or are they ready for a little professionalism in a sheriff? I honestly have no idea. Who truly knows the heart of the fickle American voter?

But I'm not the only one to speculate. The [Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/22/progressive-sheriffs-are-here-will-they-win-in-november) covers criminal justice issues and only yesterday published a timely piece: "Progressive Sheriffs Are Here. Will They Win In November?" Since Trump was elected, [Progressive sheriff](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/07/county-sheriff-elections-virginia-louisiana/) candidates have increasingly run and [won](https://www.wwno.org/news/2021-12-11/progressive-candidate-susan-hutson-wins-sheriffs-race-defeating-incumbent-marlin-gusman).

*Sheriffs in the thrall of the Dear Leader*

Part of that reason is that voters are beginning to realize just how extremist these overwhelmingly Trump-fanny-kissing sheriffs really are. Overwhelmingly white, a [survey](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/we-surveyed-u-s-sheriffs-see-their-views-on-power-race-and-immigration) by the Marshall Project of sheriff's political views showed that *less than 1%* consider themselves liberal, 75% support ultra-right politics, most regard protests in the wake of George Floyd's murder to be orchestrated by left-wing provocateurs and not reflect an authentic response to a police murder. And forget accountability. Less than half are in favor of tracking bad cops. *And so on*. In addition, a majority of sheriffs think they are [more powerful](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/does-your-sheriff-think-he-s-more-powerful-than-the-president) than a sitting U.S. president and can interpret the Constitution any way they see fit and selectively enforce laws.

In short, today's sheriff's hold views diametrically opposed to those of majorities in Democratic states like ours.

In Essex County, Massachusetts, social worker [Virginia Leigh](https://boltsmag.org/massachusetts-sheriff-candidates-outsiders-to-law-enforcement/) ran against incumbent sheriff Kevin Coppinger in the Democratic primary and got [48%](https://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2022/year_to:2022/office_id:386/stage:Primaries) of the vote — *not bad* for a first-timer. In Hampshire County, [Caitlin Sepeda](https://www.sepedaforsheriff.com/about), a nurse and (again) a first-time challenger, garnered 25% of the primary vote but hammered away on *services*. Sepeda ran on a platform of delivering treatment to inmates, pointing out that [60%](https://correctionalfunding.com/commission-report/) of her county's incarcerated people have substance abuse problems and 70% self-report mental illness. "Those are not law enforcement issues. Those are nursing issues. Those are social service issues," Sepeda [told](https://boltsmag.org/massachusetts-sheriff-candidates-outsiders-to-law-enforcement/) one reporter.

And she's absolutely right. Which brings us to the general election on November 8th.

In Barnstable County, [Donna Buckley](https://www.buckley4sheriff.com/), who is running on a platform of prioritizing programs for inmates and "preparing our inmates for pre-release," got 30,000 primary votes in the Democratic primary, while Republican Tim Whelan got only 18,000. May these proportions hold in the general election. Besides delivery of services to inmates, federal ICE programs are on the ballot. Buckley has promised to end Barnstable County's 287(g) program, the only county jail program remaining in Massachusetts.

In Bristol County, Paul Heroux is similarly promising to use — not Hodgson's cruel medieval approach — but 21st Century tools to run the county jail, to provide services to inmates, to use data-driven management to evaluate rehabilitation programs, and to focus on the mundane job of *care, custody, and control* of incarcerated people.

To invoke the incumbent’s platform, "Jail is not a country club." Well, no, it's not. But it's *also* not a torture chamber. It ought to be a short-term treatment center for mentally-ill and chemically-dependent people. The courts and the DA are in the punishing business. The sheriff provides care, custody, and control. Seems simple. Except, perhaps, for some percentage of voters who want sheriffs to impose their *own* arbitrary punishments on people already being punished.

In her latest essay in the Boston Globe, long-time Hodgson-watching columnist [Yvonne Abraham](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/22/metro/finally-hodgson-has-race/) quoted Carol Rose of the ACLU: "Voters are waking up. […] Maybe not this time, but soon, [a sheriff] is going to be held accountable by the voters." To which Abraham adds: "Please, please, let it be this time."

Amen to that.
