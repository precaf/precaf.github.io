House</em></p>
<p>Not only in Bristol County, but all over the United States, sheriffs
are on the ballot. Given the previous administration’s love affair with
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/12/politics/jeff-sessions-anglo-american-law-enforcement/index.html">Anglo-American
sheriffs</a>, America is now paying a bit more attention to these races
than ever before.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts sheriffs have extremely attenuated powers but
extremely long terms — rivaling that of a U.S. Senator — and very little
accountability — all of which affords them a lot of time and opportunity
to get into mischief.</p>
<p>By now everyone knows about Bristol County’s <em>Angry White Man</em>
sheriff — the community college dropout who has been running our jail by
the seat of his pants while making frequent trips to the border with
militia members and white supremacists. <em>Not to mention</em> letting
an indecent number of people die by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/14/inmate-apparent-suicide-bristol-county-jail-renews-concerns-about-sheriff/TuNg7IXb71nb5XNBQFmWuL/story.html">suicide</a>
while half-starving inmates and gouging their families with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/charging-for-prison-phone-calls-burdens-families/ar-AAQgq4a">usurious</a>
phone charges.</p>
<p>Tom Hodgson is like your neighbor, the do-it-yourself plumber, who
broke the toilet, flooded the first floor, and left sewage all over. Now
cooler heads have to call someone with professional skills — somebody
who actually knows what the hell he’s doing — to fix the mess the
stubborn hubby has made.</p>
<p>And <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paulheroux.org/">Paul Heroux</a> is just the
guy to do it. Heroux has a bachelor’s in psychology, a master’s in
corrections, has worked in corrections <em>doing</em> corrections, and
has been running a city government with a budget three times larger than
Hodgson’s.</p>
<p>In the process Heroux has also managed to steer clear of the state <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/an-audit-of-the-bristol-county-sheriffs-office/download">auditor</a>,
the <a

attorney general</a>, and the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/20/ice-close-two-detention-centers">Department
of Homeland Security</a> — unlike the incumbent clown who couldn’t
document a third of his expenses to the auditor’s satisfaction,
misplaced ICE payments in one of a dozen slush funds he keeps, who has
systematically violated the civil rights of his prisoners, and last year
lost his prized 287(g) program because of gross incompetence and cruelty
— cruelty borne out of pandering to and offering Republican voters angry
red meat.</p>

<p>Paul Heroux, who sometimes comes across as a brainy technocrat and

appeals</a> for lost cases that would never have been heard if the

target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/12/15/healey-hodgson-bristol-immigration-detainees-report">violating
the rights</a> of inmates or his employees.</p>
<p>No, it’s going to be the sound of <em>crickets</em> again when Heroux
is elected sheriff.</p>
<p>Besides not racking up massive legal bills paid for by taxpayers for
grandstanding and law-breaking, Heroux is also not going to write “love
letters” to racists like <a
target="_blank" href="https://hodgsonemails.wordpress.com/">Stephen Miller</a>, Trump’s
evil genius immigration advisor, or <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/12/05/thomas-hodgson-stephen-miller/">rat
out his own church</a> like Hodgson did for the “crime” of his parish
caring for undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers. For a guy who
likes to remind his Trumpy base how “Christian” he is, Hodgson sure
seems to have forgotten Exodus 22:21: “You shall not oppress or mistreat
a stranger, for you were strangers in Egypt.” Like everything about
Hodgson the <em>poseur</em>, even his piety is all show.</p>
<p>But the million-dollar question is — do voters want an aggressive
grandstander who just won’t stay in his lane and do his damn job — or
are they ready for a little professionalism in a sheriff? I honestly
have no idea. Who truly knows the heart of the fickle American
voter?</p>
<p>But I’m not the only one to speculate. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/22/progressive-sheriffs-are-here-will-they-win-in-november">Marshall
Project</a> covers criminal justice issues and only yesterday published
a timely piece: “Progressive Sheriffs Are Here. Will They Win In
November?” Since Trump was elected, <a
target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/10/07/county-sheriff-elections-virginia-louisiana/">Progressive
sheriff</a> candidates have increasingly run and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wwno.org/news/2021-12-11/progressive-candidate-susan-hutson-wins-sheriffs-race-defeating-incumbent-marlin-gusman">won</a>.</p>
<p><img src="vanity.jpg" /> <em>Sheriffs in the thrall of the Dear
Leader</em></p>
<p>Part of that reason is that voters are beginning to realize just how
extremist these overwhelmingly Trump-fanny-kissing sheriffs really are.
Overwhelmingly white, a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/we-surveyed-u-s-sheriffs-see-their-views-on-power-race-and-immigration">survey</a>
by the Marshall Project of sheriff’s political views showed that
<em>less than 1%</em> consider themselves liberal, 75% support
ultra-right politics, most regard protests in the wake of George Floyd’s
murder to be orchestrated by left-wing provocateurs and not reflect an
authentic response to a police murder. And forget accountability. Less
than half are in favor of tracking bad cops. <em>And so on</em>. In
addition, a majority of sheriffs think they are <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/does-your-sheriff-think-he-s-more-powerful-than-the-president">more
powerful</a> than a sitting U.S. president and can interpret the
Constitution any way they see fit and selectively enforce laws.</p>
<p>In short, today’s sheriff’s hold views diametrically opposed to those
of majorities in Democratic states like ours.</p>
<p>In Essex County, Massachusetts, social worker <a
target="_blank" href="https://boltsmag.org/massachusetts-sheriff-candidates-outsiders-to-law-enforcement/">Virginia
Leigh</a> ran against incumbent sheriff Kevin Coppinger in the
Democratic primary and got <a
target="_blank" href="https://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/search/year_from:2022/year_to:2022/office_id:386/stage:Primaries">48%</a>
of the vote — <em>not bad</em> for a first-timer. In Hampshire County,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sepedaforsheriff.com/about">Caitlin Sepeda</a>, a
nurse and (again) a first-time challenger, garnered 25% of the primary
vote but hammered away on <em>services</em>. Sepeda ran on a platform of
delivering treatment to inmates, pointing out that <a
target="_blank" href="https://correctionalfunding.com/commission-report/">60%</a> of her
county’s incarcerated people have substance abuse problems and 70%
self-report mental illness. “Those are not law enforcement issues. Those
are nursing issues. Those are social service issues,” Sepeda <a
target="_blank" href="https://boltsmag.org/massachusetts-sheriff-candidates-outsiders-to-law-enforcement/">told</a>
one reporter.</p>
<p>And she’s absolutely right. Which brings us to the general election
on November 8th.</p>
<p>In Barnstable County, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.buckley4sheriff.com/">Donna Buckley</a>, who is
running on a platform of prioritizing programs for inmates and
“preparing our inmates for pre-release,” got 30,000 primary votes in the
Democratic primary, while Republican Tim Whelan got only 18,000. May
these proportions hold in the general election. Besides delivery of
services to inmates, federal ICE programs are on the ballot. Buckley has
promised to end Barnstable County’s 287(g) program, the only county jail
program remaining in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In Bristol County, Paul Heroux is similarly promising to use — not
Hodgson’s cruel medieval approach — but 21st Century tools to run the
county jail, to provide services to inmates, to use data-driven
management to evaluate rehabilitation programs, and to focus on the
mundane job of <em>care, custody, and control</em> of incarcerated
people.</p>
<p>To invoke the incumbent’s platform, “Jail is not a country club.”
Well, no, it’s not. But it’s <em>also</em> not a torture chamber. It
ought to be a short-term treatment center for mentally-ill and
chemically-dependent people. The courts and the DA are in the punishing
business. The sheriff provides care, custody, and control. Seems simple.
Except, perhaps, for some percentage of voters who want sheriffs to
impose their <em>own</em> arbitrary punishments on people already being
punished.</p>
<p>In her latest essay in the Boston Globe, long-time Hodgson-watching
columnist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/22/metro/finally-hodgson-has-race/">Yvonne
Abraham</a> quoted Carol Rose of the ACLU: “Voters are waking up. […]
Maybe not this time, but soon, [a sheriff] is going to be held
accountable by the voters.” To which Abraham adds: “Please, please, let
it be this time.”</p>
<p>Amen to that.</p>
