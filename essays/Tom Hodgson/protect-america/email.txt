Ron, 

I am a criminal justice activist and citizen researcher.

Last year I wrote a long profile of Bristol County (Mass.) Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson in *The Public Eye*:

Hodgson has extensive white supremacist connections and has been involved in any number of questionable projects, including a crowdfunded border wall scheme that still cannot account for $228K. His new venture, led by Pinal County (Arizona) Sheriff Mark Lamb, is called “Protect America Now.”

The Protect America Sheriffs include: Pinal County (AZ) Sheriff Mark Lamb; Green County (MO) Sheriff Jim Arnott; Livingston County (IL) Sheriff Tony Childress; Bristol County (MA) Sheriff Thomas Hodgson; Brevard County (FL) Sheriff Wayne Ivey; Culpepper County (VA) Sheriff Scott Jenkins; and Wicomico County (MD) Sheriff  Mike Lewis. Several of these sheriffs are members of the Constitutional Sheriff's Association and at least one (Ivey) is associated with the Oathkeepers. All have extensive militia connections.

Lamb, the face and voice of Protect America Now, is a self-promoter like Hodgson and has a number of businesses and organizations through which he markets himself and his “God and Country” brand of nationalism:

However, contrary to the marketing on Fox News and elsewhere, Protect America Now is not Lamb's creation. The real director of Protect America Now is Nathan Sproul, a GOP operative who has been accused of, fired for, and charged with multiple counts of voter fraud, and who set up Protect America Now in June 2020:

“Protect America Now” was originally “Protect Arizona Now” and was created by a white supremacist named Kathy W. McKee, who still owns a couple of Protect America Now trademarks:

Somewhere around 2004-2005 there was a power struggle for control of Protect America Now between McKee and the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Sproul. Here is one account of the struggle:

Although the trademark for Protect America Now is still owned by the founder, Kathy McKee, Sproul is now the owner of a "new" Protect America Now which was established last summer.

But the story gets even more interesting because the lawyer who incorporated Protect America Now for Sproul is Kory Langhofer, a GOP lawyer who fought both the Mueller investigation for Trump and challenged Arizona election results for Trump. Protect America Now and Langhofer's offices share a common address. Langhofer is also the co-owner of Signafide, a company that uses AI to challenge ballot signatures. Langhofer also verified both his and Sproul’s connections to Protect America Now.

Two years ago, Hodgson, Lamb and Ivey were just a bunch of racist sheriffs supporting cruel immigration policies promoted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Trump's immigration advisor Stephen Miller. Last year Hodgson was named honorary Trump campaign chair in Massachusetts and seems to have finally established deeper, more mainstream, GOP connections. As the GOP has embraced nativism, extremists have become mainstream. The behind-the-scenes involvement of Nathan Sproul and Kory Langhofer seem to confirm this.

Not so long ago it was extremists who worked behind the scenes to support a party of racists and xenophobes. Now it’s the party that operates behind the scenes to support the racists.

If you have any further ideas of where this story might go, please reach out.
