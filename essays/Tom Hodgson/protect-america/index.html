<p>Those who have watched Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson for any
length of time know of his <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politicalresearch.org/2020/10/13/new-englands-joe-arpaio">extensive
white supremacist connections</a> and attention-grabbing moves like
instituting chain gangs, offering to have his prisoners build Trump’s
border wall, informing on his own church in unctuous letters to former
immigration advisor Stephen Miller, or personally participating in a
jail riot. Hodgson is restless and ambitious, and he spends much of his
time traveling at Massachusetts taxpayer expense to events organized by
the Republican Party or by the Federation for American Immigration
Reform (FAIR), the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), and spinoffs
like Advocates for Illegal Alien Crime (AVIAC), most of which both the
ADL and SPLC count as hate groups.</p>
<p><img src="pan.png" /></p>
<p>Hodgson’s newest project is called <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://protectamericanow.com/">Protect America Now</a></em>,
which purports to be simply seven God-and-Country sheriffs who oppose
immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, secularism, and
socialism. The sheriffs include: the group’s spokesman, Pinal County
(AZ) Sheriff Mark Lamb; Green County (MO) Sheriff Jim Arnott; Livingston
County (IL) Sheriff Tony Childress; Bristol County (MA) Sheriff Thomas
Hodgson; Brevard County (FL) Sheriff Wayne Ivey; Culpeper County (VA)
Sheriff Scott Jenkins; and Wicomico County (MD) Sheriff Mike Lewis.</p>
<p>Despite <em>Protect America Now’s</em> call to help “stand strong
against lawlessness,” most refuse to enforce state gun control laws or
COVID-19 mask or social-distancing <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/hodgson-supremacy-1?s=r">mandates</a>.
Instead, the sheriffs support <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pinal-county-sheriff-citizens-posse-program-allows-residents-to-be-deputized">arming
and deputizing</a> their mainly white counties against both urban
protesters and border “invaders.”</p>
<p><img src="lamb.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pinal County (AZ) Sheriff Mark Lamb is the public face of <em>Protect
America Now</em>. Lamb is a self-promoter with numerous <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/people/arizona/mark-lamb.html">businesses</a>
and organizations <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sherifflamb.com/">through which
he</a> and his wife <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sheriffswife.com/">Janel</a>
market themselves and their “God and Country” brand of nationalism. He
has interests in two pest control businesses with <a
target="_blank" href="https://bugpoliceaz.com/">police themes</a>. One of Lamb’s
“charities,” the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.americansheriff.com/">American
Sheriff Foundation</a>, took in $50,000 in donations but <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/charity-founded-by-pinal-county-sheriff-mark-lamb-has-dollar18000-in-unaccounted-spending/ar-BB18ygnB">can
not account</a> for $18,000 of it. The Foundation’s main function seems
to be to sell Lamb’s “brand” and the couple’s books about themselves.
Lamb is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/attorney-general-opens-investigation-into-pinal-county-sheriff-mark-lamb/article_97659afe-2ebc-11eb-a83e-cb6e1997a1b4.html">being
investigated</a> by the Arizona Attorney General for refusing to seize
property in 2018 owned by the family of a lobbyist friend.</p>
<p>Lamb is a “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/17/us-police-far-right-capitol-attack">Constitutional
Sheriff</a>” who claimed in one speech to the Arizona Police Association
that “the constitution is hanging by a thread”. He belongs to the
Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association founded by former
Arizona sheriff Richard Mack and appeared at CSPOA’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://cspoa.org/product/cspoa-2020-virginia-conference-highlight-video-download/">2020
Virginia Conference</a>. At least three other <em>Protect America
Now</em> sheriffs, Thomas <a
target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oeluPOu7ZcoubHa2zJPycyRKy9dEVb3/view?usp=sharing">Hodgson</a>,
Scott <a

and Wayne <a

are also CSPOA members.</p>
<p>Jessica Pishko, in a <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/constitutional-sheriffs-white-supremacists-capitol-riot-insurrection.html">Slate</a>
article entitled “Sheriffs Helped Lead This Insurrection,” hit the nail
on the head when she wrote that “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/new-report-90-of-americas-sheriffs-are-white-men/">ninety
percent of American sheriffs</a> are white men, and in recent years
they’ve become strongly affiliated with white supremacist groups. Across
the country, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/18/the-rise-of-the-anti-lockdown-sheriffs">sheriffs</a>
have declared that they will not enforce laws they deem
‘unconstitutional,’ like COVID-19 public health orders or <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/us/state-gun-laws.html">gun
laws</a> limiting weapons possession and permits. Their influence has
only grown since the pandemic began, as mask wearing became affiliated
with progressive liberals and a bare face was a sign of Trump support.
Trump has always had an affinity with sheriffs. He met with more <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2020/01/20/all-president-sheriffs-how-one-law-enforcement-group-became-ardent-trump-supporters/YvqIHMRszFqljv0q2oIZpI/story.html">sheriffs
at the White House</a> than any other president and pardoned ex-Sheriff
Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for failing to abide
by a nondiscrimination order, calling him an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/donald-trump-joe-arpaio-pardon-arizona-sheriff">‘American
patriot.’</a>”</p>
<p>The <em>Protect America Now</em> sheriffs — contrary to their mission
to “stand strong against lawlessness” have arrogated themselves the
additional roles of lawmakers and judges, picking and choosing which
laws they flout and which they enforce. Many of these choices hinge on
race.</p>
<p>Pishko <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/constitutional-sheriffs-white-supremacists-capitol-riot-insurrection.html">explains</a>
the racist origins: “[…] the constitutional sheriff movement has
explicitly white supremacist roots. When the Supreme Court held in
<em><a target="_blank" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/">Brown
v. Board of Education</a></em> that racial segregation was
unconstitutional, county sheriffs were among the <a
target="_blank" href="https://segregationinamerica.eji.org/report/massive-resistance.html">Southern
officials</a> who defied the court’s decision. They claimed that, in
fact, desegregation was unconstitutional and invoked a legal theory
called ‘<a
target="_blank" href="http://www.roanoketeaparty.com/interposition-in-action-if-one-sheriff-can-do-this-imagine-what-a-state-could-accompish/">interposition</a>,’
which argues that states can independently decide federal laws are
unconstitutional and nullify them.”</p>
<p>Which is precisely the approach Trump and the GOP took in fighting
both impeachment and Trump’s election loss.</p>
<p>When asked for comment on the January 6th Capitol insurrection, Lamb
seemed to echo QAnon, attributing insurrectionist anger to the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/01/07/these-arizona-republicans-say-trump-isnt-to-blame-for-capitol-riot/6580354002/">unpunished
crimes</a> of Hillary Clinton and <a
target="_blank" href="https://theappeal.org/the-cops-at-the-capitol/">defending the
rioters</a>: “I don’t know how loud we have to get before they have to
listen to us and know we will no longer tolerate them stripping our
freedoms away.” Lamb also repeated accusations of Democrat election
fraud in a <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/constitutional-sheriffs-white-supremacists-capitol-riot-insurrection.html">video</a>
that he subsequently took down.</p>
<p><img src="aviac.jpg" /></p>
<p>Lamb is well-connected with the white supremacist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190711005621/en/%20Crisis-Border-Coalition-Immigration-National-Security-Border">Tanton
network</a>, its groups FAIR, CIS, NumbersUSA, Angel Families, AVIAC, as
well as border wall scammers like Steve Bannon (pardoned), Brian Kolfage
(indicted), and Tom Hodgson, whose <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/2019/01/white-agenda/">crowdfunding</a>
partnership with the now-defunct American Border Foundation, still can
not account for more than $227,000 it collected.</p>
<p>While Lamb may be the poster boy for <em>Protect America Now</em>,
six more sheriffs round out the roster. Some of them are less the
ideologue than just cruel, arbitrary, racist, and crooked jailers who
work for a white constituency that thinks cruelty is the only way to run
jails and conduct police patrols.</p>
<p><img src="arnott.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sheriff Jim Arnott serves Green County in the Missouri Ozarks. Like
his brothers in <em>Protect America Now</em>, Arnott does things
<em>his</em> way, voters and employees be damned. Arnott has made a name
for himself insisting on his officers’ belief in a deity. When asked by
one reporter what he would do if one of his deputies objected to his <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.opposingviews.com/religion/missouri-sheriff-if-deputy-opposes-god-we-trust-then-work-somewhere-else-video">mandatory</a>
“In God We Trust” decal, Arnott replied, “Well, I guess he’d have to
work somewhere else if he didn’t like it that bad.”</p>
<p>Like several other sheriffs, including Tom Hodgson, who was
investigated by Homeland Security, the Massachusetts Attorney General,
and a Congressional delegation for his personal participation in a
correctional officer riot, Arnott runs a cruel, filthy jail where <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/its-a-bad-situation-inside-the-greene-county-jails-covid-19-outbreak/ar-BB17Vddw">half
those incarcerated</a> have contracted COVID-19. In 2018 a county
employee blew the whistle on Arnott’s sheriff’s department being pressed
into a political campaign for a county tax increase. Arnott <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Auditor-Nicole-Galloway-provides-Greene-County-information-about-1-of-22-whistleblowers-472205243.html">sued
the state</a> for the identity of the whistleblower and launched a
barrage of press releases designed to fight the case in the court of
public opinion. Arnott even <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/opinion/contributors/2018/04/30/still-lot-smoke-greene-county/563567002/">harassed
a county commissioner</a> who had objected to Arnott’s ethics
violations. Ultimately <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2019/12/05/judge-rules-against-sheriff-favor-auditor-whistleblower-suit/2618541001/">Arnott
lost</a> his case and finally had to admit that he had indeed <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/opinion/contributors/2018/04/30/still-lot-smoke-greene-county/563567002/">violated
state ethics</a> laws.</p>
<p><img src="childress.jpg" /></p>
<p>Tony Childress of Livingston County, Illinois, is <em>Protect America
Now’s</em> only Black sheriff. Childress was one of the Federation for
American Immigration Reform’s earliest converts to its xenophobic
“border invasion” campaign. With fellow <em>Protect America Now</em>
members Hodgson and Jenkins, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.oregonir.org/issues/northern-sheriffs-get-close-look-border-crisis">Childress
attended</a> a FAIR- and CIS-led junket to the Mexican border in 2014.
Childress was also one of 40 sheriffs who <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wpri.com/news/washington-dc/trump-meets-with-sheriffs-on-immigration-border-security/">met
with former president Trump</a> in 2019 about hardening border security.
In 2018 Childress was found to have engaged in a little double-dipping —
serving as sheriff while also working as a security consultant for <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.pontiacdailyleader.com/news/20180126/isa-sheriff-statement-supports-extra-job">Innovative
Security Solutions</a>. Childress defended his actions with the usual
sheriff defense — whatever he had done was done <em>solely</em> in the
interests of public safety.</p>
<p><img src="ivey.jpg" /></p>
<p>Brevard County, Florida Sheriff Wayne Ivey is the living, breathing
incarnation of the Southern sheriff. In 2013 Ivey re-introduced
slave-style <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/02/brevard-county-sheriff-chain-gang/2130335/">chain
gangs</a>. It was a racist touch that Arizona’s Joe Arpaio used and
which Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson has also tried. If Ivey’s chain
gangs were not bad enough, Brevard County’s sheriff produces “Wheel of
Fugitive” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=910612892354799">videos</a> and
encourages the county’s 83% white citizens to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqLWBfir9Yg">arm themselves</a>.
Slave catching is alive and well in Brevard County.</p>
<p>In 2018 Ivey’s deputies <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.floridatoday.com/in-depth/news/2019/11/08/army-veteran-ptsd-dies-brevard-jail/1584907001/">murdered
Gregory Edwards</a>, a jailed Black veteran, by punching, tasing, and
pepper-spraying him before placing a hood over his head and strapping
him into a chair. Edwards died of a non-medical “police diagnosis”
called “excited delirium.” At first Ivey <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/jail-video-released-of-brevard-county-inmate-death">refused</a>
to turn over the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/11/02/brevard-jail-video-of-inmate-death-wont-be-released-before-election-day/">videos</a>
of Edwards’ death, but eventually agreed to turn over a sanitized
version. In 2020 Ivey’s deputies <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-teens-fatally-shot-by-brevard-county-deputy-20201117-srcsnuvh4zcs7lfwzhtftm3w4i-story.html">murdered
two Black teenagers</a>,18-year-old Sincere Pierce and 16-year-old
Angelo Crooms, by shooting into their moving car. Again Ivey refused at
first to release the video.</p>
<p>After his deputies killed Edwards, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/15/gregory-edwards-florida-sheriff-makes-uncomfortable-visit-widow/3190204001/">Ivey
paid a surprise visit</a> to Edwards’ widow “for a welfare check.” Ivey,
ringed by half a dozen deputies, showed up at Kathleen Edwards’ home
unannounced, demanded she “step outside,” upon which Ivey grabbed and
then, inexplicably and grotesquely, hugged her. It was a bizarre, cruel,
and menacing visit. “Out of respect for Mrs. Edwards’ privacy, the
Sheriff’s Office will not be commenting on the nature or purpose of
tonight’s service call at her residence,” Ivey’s media spokesman said,
while acknowledging that the deputies had also filmed the staged
confrontation.</p>
<p>Like Sheriff Arnott, Ivey insists that his deputies affix “In God We
Trust” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-sheriff-god-atheist-complain">decals</a>
to their vehicles. And for those who like their <em>God and Country</em>
nationalism in equal doses, Ivey also insists on <a
target="_blank" href="https://spacecoastdaily.com/2021/02/sheriff-wayne-ivey-brevard-sheriffs-office-to-start-every-monday-morning-with-the-playing-of-the-national-anthem/">playing
the national anthem</a> or staging some “patriotic moment” every Monday.
In 2017 the City of Orlando passed the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-orlando-sanctuary-cities-activists-20171114-story.html">Trust
Act</a>, which limited the ability of city police to assist ICE. In 2018
outraged county commissioners, with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.numbersusa.com/news/brevard-county-florida-adopts-anti-sanctuary-policy">Ivey’s
help</a>, sponsored an “anti-sanctuary” resolution.</p>
<p>For all his faux devotion to God and Country, upright behavior has
not been the result. In 2011 Ivey retired from the Florida department of
law enforcement (FDLE) three days after he was <a
target="_blank" href="https://volusiaexposed.com/fdle/ivey/phonecall.pdf">accused</a> of
threatening a female probation officer who just happened to be the
former fiancee of Ivey’s son Robert.</p>
<p>Like Mark Lamb, Ivey sounded the alarm when Black Lives Matter began
protesting police murders. At the height of the protests in June 2020,
Attorney <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/06/10/florida-community-leader-alton-edmond-files-run-brevard-sheriff-challenges-wayne-ivey/5331623002/">Alton
Edmond</a>, who organized a George Floyd rally that drew more than 3,000
people, announced an election challenge to Ivey. It was the first time
the Democratic Party had bothered to challenge the Republican.</p>
<p><img src="jenkins.jpg" /></p>
<p>Scott Jenkins is the Sheriff in Culpeper County, Virginia. In
September 2020 Jenkins posted a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/some-culpeper-co-residents-considering-legal-action-to-remove-the-sheriff/65-6bdb7926-3cc8-407d-9e8e-b9af16f67bf6">video</a>
rant on his department’s Facebook page: “Citizens should alert
themselves to the true nature of this violence and realize the intent is
for it to continue across our nation during the months ahead. Antifa and
the Black Lives Matter movement is not peaceful and at their heart are
violent. They may bring their violence to any community at any time and
especially where they see weakness in local government officials. These
are a few of the many examples across our nation.”</p>
<p>So frightened of Black protesters was Jenkins that he advocated
turning his county’s 80% white citizenry into <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/culpeper-co-sheriff-prepared-to-turn-citizens-into-reserve-deputies-if-gun-bills-pass-in-virginia/ar-BB174f3w">reserve
deputies</a> to fight “lawlessness,” <a
target="_blank" href="https://wjla.com/news/local/culpeper-sheriff-gun-control-laws-constitutionality">gun
control</a> and other forms of legislative or judicial “meddling” that
<em>he</em>, Scott Jenkins, determined to be “unconstitutional.” Jenkins
<a
target="_blank" href="https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2020/07/22/sheriff-deputize-armed-citizens-n38511">openly
flouts</a> his state’s gun laws. And if it sounds like the sheriff might
just be a CSPOA member, well, it’s because he is.</p>
<p>A number of county residents have launched a legal effort to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/some-culpeper-co-residents-considering-legal-action-to-remove-the-sheriff/65-6bdb7926-3cc8-407d-9e8e-b9af16f67bf6">recall</a>
Jenkins, and he was sued by the Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls
Church, Virginia, for handing over an undocumented immigrant to ICE in
2017. After serving his time in the county jail, Francisco Guardado Rios
was held past his release date in order to be turned over to ICE, as
Jenkins had done to 100 other undocumented detainees. It was
unconstitutional and violated even state law, but Jenkins fought law and
precedent, <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/CONRAD/riosjenkinsopor715.pdf">finally
prevailing</a> in U.S. District Court. This made him a hero to the far
right.</p>
<p><img src="lewis.jpg" /></p>
<p>Wicomico County, Maryland Sheriff Mike Lewis is another <em>Protect
America Now</em> sheriff who <a
target="_blank" href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/enforcement-of-gun-laws-hinges-on-local-sheriffs-interpretation-of-second-amendment/">refuses
to enforce gun laws</a>. “State police and highway patrol get their
orders from the governor,” Lewis said. “I get my orders from the
citizens in this county.” In a video <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/23/sheriff-defends-gun-rights-viral-video/16100151/">Lewis
told one reporter</a>, “As long as I’m the sheriff in this county, I
will not allow the federal government to come in here and strip <em>my
citizens</em> of their right to bear arms. I can tell you this, if they
attempt to do that, it would be an all-out civil war, no question about
it.”</p>
<p>Responding to Lewis’ inflammatory rhetoric, the Coalition to Stop Gun
Violence <a
target="_blank" href="http://csgv.org/action/tell-maryland-police-training-commission-revoke-michael-lewis-certification/">launched
a petition</a> calling for the Maryland Police Training Commission to
revoke Lewis’ certification. “It is difficult to see how a law
enforcement officer who is threatening to wage war with the United
States government meets any recognized standards of public service. In
the wake of his threatening comments, Sheriff Lewis should not be given
the responsibility of training law enforcement officers in
Maryland.”</p>
<p><img src="sproul.jpg" /></p>
<p>Contrary to <em>Protect America Now’s</em> marketing on Fox News and
elsewhere, <em>Protect America Now</em> is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/people/arizona/mark-lamb.html">not
Lamb’s creation</a>. It turns out the <a

target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/opinion/allegations-of-electoral-crimes.html">Nathan
Sproul</a>, a GOP operative who has been accused of, fired for, and
charged with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-gop-paying-consultant-dogged-by-voter-fraud-charges/">multiple
counts of voter fraud</a>, and who set up <em>Protect America Now</em>
most recently in June 2020. As a sometime associate of Karl Rove,
Sproul’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.salon.com/2012/10/15/karl_rove_tied_to_shady_gop_operative_nathan_sproul/">whole
career</a> has been devoted to voter suppression and dirty tricks.</p>
<p><img src="mckee.jpg" /></p>
<p>It is no coincidence that today’s <em>Protect America Now</em> has is
roots in a similar organization created 18 years ago or that Nathan
Sproul was involved in both. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/protect-america-now-pan2.html">trademark</a>
for <em>Protect America Now</em> was created in 2004 and was the
brainchild of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dandb.com/businessdirectory/protectamericanow-glendale-az-12614304.html">Kathy
W. McKee</a>, who is still listed on a PAC <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/protect-arizona-now-committee.html">registration</a>
with a similar name. McKee was also the force behind Arizona’s 2004
bill. <a
target="_blank" href="https://apps.azsos.gov/election/2004/Info/PubPamphlet/english/prop200.pdf">Proposition
200</a>, a voter suppression bill. As soon as McKee got Prop 200 on the
ballot, the GOP and every brownshirt and satin-sheeted group took an
interest.</p>
<p><img src="abernethy.jpg" /></p>
<p>But McKee made the mistake of bringing a white supremacist, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/virginia-abernethy">Dr. Virginia
Abernethy</a>, onto the organization’s national advisory board.
Abernethy turned out to be even too extreme for the rest of PAN’s
racists and xenophobes, so the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, which had previously supported McKee and Abernethy, stepped in
to save Prop 200 despite its <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/ignoring-its-own-ties-anti-immigration-group-denounces-white-separatist">previous
support</a> for Abernethy.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2005 there was a power struggle for control of
<em>Protect America Now</em> between McKee and the Federation for
American Immigration Reform and, once again, it involved Nathan Sproul.
As he had done with the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/news/kanye-wests-campaign-has-hired-gop-operative-with-history-of-controversial-work/article_3b34db9f-d19f-5b34-8a93-c93572b001a7.html">Kanye
2020</a> campaign, in 2004 Sproul paid signature collectors to get <a
target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/article/nader-s-dubious-raiders/">Ralph
Nader</a> on the ballot in order to siphon Democratic votes. But while
Sproul’s signature gatherers were getting Nader on the ballot their
prime mission was gathering signatures for the voter suppression
bill.</p>
<p><img src="langhofer.jpg" /></p>
<p>The story gets even weirder when we learn that the lawyer who
incorporated <em>Protect America Now</em> for Sproul is Kory Langhofer,
an equally <a
target="_blank" href="https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-campaign-lawyer-caught-using-his-business-partner-as-witness-in-sharpiegate-case/">ethically-unencumbered</a>
GOP lawyer who fought both the <a

Arizona election results</a> for Trump. <em>Protect America Now</em> and
Langhofer’s offices share a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rnla.org/korylanghofer">common address</a>. Langhofer
is also the co-owner of <a
target="_blank" href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/291866-signafide-promises-funnel-suspect-signatures">Signafide</a>,
a company that uses artificial intelligence software to challenge ballot
signatures.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Hodgson, Lamb, Ivey and the others were just a bunch
of Stetson-hatted MAGA zealots supporting cruel immigration policies
promoted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Trump’s
immigration advisor Stephen Miller. But by dutifully groveling and doing
whatever was asked of them, each has established a closer personal
connection to Donald Trump and to a Republican Party that finally looks
like them.</p>
<p>As the GOP increasingly embraces nativism, the extremists have gone
mainstream. Involvement by high level GOP operatives like Nathan Sproul
and Kory Langhofer with sheriffs like Hodgson and their dangerous
militia and white supremacist connections says a lot about the party’s
transformation.</p>
<p>Not so very long ago it was racist and xenophobic extremists who
worked behind the scenes to support the GOP. Now it’s the Republican
Party operating behind the scenes to support the extremists.</p>
