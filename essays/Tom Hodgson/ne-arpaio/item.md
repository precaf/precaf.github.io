Last year I began working on a profile of Bristol County Thomas M. Hodgson's associations with far right and white supremacist organizations for *[The Public Eye](https://www.politicalresearch.org/public-eye-magazine)* magazine. It took a long time to research and write, and even longer to edit, but after Covid-related delays it is finally out and you can read it online [here](https://www.politicalresearch.org/2020/10/13/new-englands-joe-arpaio) or download the issue's PDF [here](https://www.politicalresearch.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/ThePublicEye_2020_Summer_NoBleeds.pdf).

Allow me to plug buying a [subscription](https://www.politicalresearch.org/subscribe) to PRA's print magazine, even in the digital age. Your support will help *Political Research Associates* keep investigating and reporting on America's extreme Right.

PRA is running a [Fall Webinar series](https://www.politicalresearch.org/fall-webinar-series-2020) that so far has tackled sheriffs, militias, and austerity. They have all been interesting and the moderator does a great job of posing questions and keeping everyone on schedule. Tomorrow's webinar is [Mobilizing Misogyny in the Service of Authoritarianism](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_uKBHBmD-R3SZiic3643HbA).
