<p>On October 31st Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson dropped another
<a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SheriffHodgson/status/1587206119969079296">Willie
Horton style campaign ad</a>. He’d already tried to frighten voters by
accusing his opponent of coddling pedophiles with a non-existent vote on
non-existent legislation.</p>
<p>This time Hodgson’s target was George Soros — who Hodgson accused of
coddling criminals, funding his opponent, and having the ultimate goal
of destroying America: “<em>They</em> have their sights set on our way
of life,” Hodgson warned with an ominous “they.”</p>
<p>The hate groups Hodgson works with — and on whose advisory board he
sits — all hate Soros, a Hungarian Jewish philanthropist who was
<em>not</em> involved in funding the anti-Hodgson campaign ads that have
so irked the sheriff. Nope, it was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.org/founders-projects/everytown-for-gun-safety/">Everytown
for Gun Safety</a>, the work of American Jewish philanthropist Michael
Bloomberg, a frequent thorn in the side of NRA shills like Hodgson.</p>
<p>At first blush the sheriff, who already has a racism problem, didn’t
seem to be able to keep his Jews straight.</p>
<p>But Hodgson’s “mistake” was intentional. Like his dishonest
pedophile-coddling scare ad, this one was calculated to reach a certain
constituency who watches <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/glenn-becks-anti-semitic-attack-on-george-soros">Glen
Beck</a> (“Soros: The Puppet Master”) or <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6310442726112">Tucker Carlson</a>
(“Soros has decided to destroy the American justice system”) — a
constituency whose political heroes returned recently from <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.conservative.org/cpac/cpac-hungary/">CPAC-Hungary</a>,
where autocratic Christian nationalist president Viktor Orban, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-soros-funded-central-european-university-forced-out-of-hungary-by-pm-viktor-orban/">shut
down</a> a university Soros founded and used the pandemic as a pretext
for a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-hungarys-coronavirus-law-orbans-power-grab">power
grab</a>.</p>
<p>For today’s new crop of antisemites, George Soros has replaced a 19th
Century <em>j’accuse</em> involving financier <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/story/where-do-anti-semitic-conspiracy-theories-about-the-rothschild-family-come-from">Nathan
Rothschild</a> which went on to become a 200-year conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SheriffHodgson/status/1587206119969079296">sheriff’s
antisemitic ad</a> was promptly slammed by Elizabeth <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1587818723611746307">Warren</a>,
Ed <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wpri.com/news/elections/markey-dems-rebuke-sheriff-hodgson-over-campaign-ad-referencing-soros/">Markey</a>,
Deborah Goldberg, and other Massachusetts politicos. <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SheriffHodgson/status/1587206119969079296">Hodgson’s
Tweet</a> also drew more than 60 comments, most <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hodgson-antisemitism.html">negative</a>:
“Well if that isn’t the most antisemitic thing I’ve heard all day…
Honestly Southeastern MA, he is the biggest embarrassment in the
Commonwealth… Your mustache is too wide. You gotta trim it to just a
little patch under your nose… Halloween’s over but maybe next year you
can go full Nazi cosplay…”</p>
<p>Another <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dancindoti/status/1587819151346860034">commented</a>:
“These people no longer have dog whistles they have bull horns. It is no
longer a silent wink wink it is full out public bigotry…”</p>
<p><img src="bs.png" /></p>
<p>In choosing George Soros — the wrong Jew, and he knew it! — Hodgson
was trotting out time-worn antisemitic tropes, implying that “they” are
unpatriotic and systematically destroying “our way of life” — which MAGA
politicians themselves freely call white <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-christian-nationalism-comments-social-media-reaction-1712733">Christian
nationalism</a>. There’s really not much of a line between this and the
Charlottesville <em>tiki-torch</em> neo-Nazis with their “Jews will not
replace us.”</p>
<p>For years the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/about/who-we-are">Anti-Defamation League</a>
has tracked two organizations Hodgson is intimately involved with — the
Federation for American Immigration Reform (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/federation-american-immigration-reform’s-hate-filled-track-record">FAIR</a>)
and the Center for Immigration Studies (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/does-the-center-for-immigration-studies-deserve-to-be-labeled-a-hate-group/2017/03/24/89ab4cda-0f38-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_story.html">CIS</a>).
The ADL’s factsheet “Mainstreaming Hate” describes one a as hate group
and the other as an extremist organization. In 2018 the ADL published
“The Antisemitism Lurking Behind George Soros Conspiracy Theories,”
which explains why groups like FAIR and CIS are <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/blog/the-antisemitism-lurking-behind-george-soros-conspiracy-theories">so
obsessed with</a> Soros. They routinely employ precisely the same dog
whistles Hodgson used not-so-subtly in his antisemitic campaign ad:
“They have their sights set on our way of life.”</p>
<p>In his defense, Hodgson tweeted that he couldn’t possibly be an
antisemite because his parents are buried in a private crypt on the
Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Yet antisemitism was no impediment to
Hodgson’s father, “Sir John,” being buried in Israel. According to a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hiding-out-tina-alexis-allen?variant=32116612759586">memoir</a>
written by Hodgson’s youngest sister, their parents were given a private
crypt in Israel because of “Sir John’s” services to the Vatican. The
memoir recounts numerous examples of the father’s antisemitism. The
elder Hodgson’s burial in a churchyard says everything about his
connection to the Church and nothing about respect for Jews.</p>
<p>For years Hodgson has attended events sponsored by FAIR and its front
groups, as well as an event called “Hold their Feet to the Fire,” where
sheriffs and a variety of homophobes, Neo-confederates, Muslim-bashers,
antisemites, and Christian Nationalists fill slots on right-wing talk
radio programs. In 2016 Hodgson <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/hodgson-2016.jpg">gave
a talk</a> at a FAIR national advisory meeting that preceded one by Ira
Mehlman entitled “Soros Hacked: The Truth Behind His Big Money Network
to Destroy U.S. Borders.”</p>
<p><img src="soros.jpg" /></p>
<p>Mehlman calls Soros’ <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/2017-08/September2016_IR.pdf">Open
Society Institute</a> a “shadowy foundation” with a “globalist agenda”
to attack U.S. immigration policy. But “globalist” is white supremacist
code for “Jewish” and FAIR and CIS have an axe to grind with Soros not
<em>only</em> because he is a liberal philanthropist, but
<em>especially</em> because he is a liberal Jew.</p>
<p>The American Jewish Committee has <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ajc.org/translatehate/globalist">this</a> to say about
so-called “globalists”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Much like <em>dual loyalty</em>, <em>Globalist</em> is used to
promote the antisemitic conspiracy that Jewish people do not have
allegiance to their countries of origin, like the United States, but to
some worldwide order—like a global economy or international political
system—that will enhance their control over the world’s banks,
governments, and media. […] Today, Globalist is a coded word for Jews
who are seen as international elites conspiring to weaken or dismantle
“Western” society using their international connections and control over
big corporations (see <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ajc.org/translatehate/New-World-Order">New World
Order</a>)—all echoing the destructive theory that Jews hold greed and
tribe above country.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2001 Stephen Steinlight published a report for the <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Report/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography">Center
for Immigration Studies</a> — a group with which Hodgson has testified
at Congress many times — entitled “The Jewish State in America’s
Changing Demography.” Steinlight blasted secular Jews for their
historical support for liberal immigration policies, arguing that
Mexicans would soon erode Jewish political power. Steinlight said that
his own views had been changed though dialogue with CIS Executive
Director <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.laprogressive.com/immigration-reform/mark-krikorian-haitis-screwed-wasnt-colonized-long">Mark
Krikorian</a>, a racist who once said “My guess is that Haiti’s so
screwed up because it wasn’t colonized long enough…”</p>
<p>In 2004 Steinlight <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Report/High-Noon-Midnight-Why-Current-Immigration-Policy-Dooms-American-Jewry">ratcheted
up</a> his polemics with an essay, “High Noon to Midnight: Why Current
Immigration Policy Dooms American Jewry,” but he still wasn’t making
progress with secular Jews. By 2010 Steinlight was frustrated and angry
at his co-religionists, <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Steinlight/Jewish-Establishment-Censorship-Information-Immigration-Policy">accusing
leading Jewish organizations</a> of censorship and repression.</p>
<p>In 2015 Hodgson joined American Family Association’s governmental
affairs director and FOX News contributor Sandy Rios on her radio show
at the U.S. Capitol. Rios claims that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/sandy-rios-says-secular-jews-have-been-the-worst-enemies-of-the-country/">secular
Jews</a> have been the worst enemy of the country, that “so many of the
Jews in this country are atheist” and “sometimes turn out to be <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_RpyH8B194&amp;feature=youtu.be">the
worst enemies of the country</a>” — a sentiment that former president
and Hodgson idol Donald Trump echoed on October 16th when he wrote,
“Jews have to get their act together…”</p>
<p>Hodgson is so often found in cesspools with antisemites and racists
that he can hardly smell the sewage. A case in point is Hodgson’s
flirtation with Rick Wiles, a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/trunews-and-rick-wiles-end-times-anti-semitism-and-anti-zionism">virulent
antisemite</a> and Christian nationalist who <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/7/3/1399014/-End-Times-broadcaster-Rick-Wiles-Renounces-his-American-Citizenship-because-of-Marriage-Equality">renounced</a>
his US citizenship because of marriage equality. Wiles broadcasts an
“End Time” radio program that has <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TRUNEWS-112614.mp4">featured
Hodgson</a> and received <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/business/media/trunews-white-house-press-credentials.html">Trump
White House</a> press credentials.</p>
<p>Hodgson’s numerous and habitual problems with hate groups and bigotry
are bad enough. But this is what he has chosen to do instead of
competently running his jails and making a best effort to rehabilitate
people.</p>
<p>Vote this embarrassment out of office on November 8th.</p>
<p>Choose Paul Heroux.</p>
