There is a great piece in the Massachusetts political blog [HesterPrynne](https://hesterprynne.net/2018/01/25/on-tuesday-charlie-baker-wont-be-able-to-target-trump-without-saying-his-name/) about the Trumpian evil lurking beneath Charlie Baker's popularity with the legislature. For starters Baker funnels money to the national GOP, hardly a troop of Boy Scouts. And now there's [Baker's ICE bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H3870), entitled "An Act empowering law enforcement to cooperate with the United States to transfer custody of convicted criminals."

As anyone familiar with 287(g) agreements knows, prisons participating in ICE agreements do *not* exclusively transfer custody of "convicted criminals" but instead *any* undocumented person who ends up in jail for even minor offenses. Baker's bill capitalizes on his bizarre popularity with Democratic legislators to sell Jeff Sessions' and Donald Trump's racist immigration policies.

[HesterPrynne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hester_Prynne) points out that ICE handovers *should* already have been settled with the Supreme Judicial Court's Lunn decision. Baker's bill is an attempt to neuter its provisions:

> On Tuesday, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on the immigration [bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H3870) the Governor filed in August in response to a [decision](http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/477/477mass517.html) by the Supreme Judicial Court. That decision, which held that no authority exists to allow Massachusetts law enforcement officials to detain persons who are wanted only because of civil immigration violations, has barred police in the state from assisting with the President’s deportation agenda by holding such persons until ICE can come pick them up.

She also notes that if Baker's "bill were to become law, he’d be the one to enlist our State Police in Trump’s reprehensible cause."

The [Joint Committee on the Judiciary has scheduled hearings](https://malegislature.gov/Events/Hearings/Detail/2874) in Boston on Tuesday, January 30, from 1:00-5:00 PM in Room A-2, to consider the [governor's bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H3870). Written testimony can be submitted at the hearing, to the Committee on the Judiciary in Room 136, by mail, or by email sent to [Philip McLaughlin](mailto:Philip.McLaughlin@mahouse.gov). If you would like to **travel to the State House for the hearings**, let us know. Maybe we can organize something.

**Reminder:**

**On January 29th** [Bristol County for Correctional Justice](https://bccjustice.org/) is holding a meeting at 105 William Street, Suite 26, at 6:30pm. Please try to make it. We have several important issues to discuss.
