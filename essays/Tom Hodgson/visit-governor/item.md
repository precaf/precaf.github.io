**Join Bristol County for Correctional Justice at Governor Charlie Baker's office** in the State House to again ask him to investigate abuses at the Bristol County House of Correction. Governor Baker has not responded to our certified [letter](baker.pdf) delivered on Aug. 24th, so now we'll plead our case in person! We are asking the governor to compel [his appointed officials](healey.pdf) to investigate Sheriff Hodgson.

**We've chartered a FREE bus on Thursday, October 18th**:

- Pick up in New Bedford at 9 AM from Park & Ride (Mt. Pleasant St.)
- Pick up in Fall River at NY Bagel at 9:30 AM
- Return to Fall River by 4:10 PM
- Return to New Bedford by 5:00 PM

Make sure to bring your own lunch and beverages. Check for rain.

Bristol County House of Correction **(BCHOC) facilities are notorious for**:
