Few people who listened to Donald Trump's first State of the Union speech could fail to miss his remarks on minorities and immigrants. This is a demagogue playing to a far-right base by expanding a deportation machine. This is an unrepentant racist who now makes it clear he doesn't want even legal immigration if it involves brown people.

In New Hampshire since last summer American citizens on I-93 have been stopped at roadblocks in Thornton, forced to show their ids, and had their cars searched in violation of what's left of the Fourth Amendment. In Fort Lauderdale last week, agents stopped and boarded a Greyhound bus and again demanded to see everyone's id. A video of the spectacle provoked widespread condemnation.

This is not a sign of a healthy democracy, nor is it an America most of us want to live in. It's a little too reminiscent of the pogroms of Germany of 1935. And this is why we need the Safe Communities Act, now before the Massachusetts legislature.

State legislators want to protect the public, and they also want to provide law enforcement officials with the tools to do it. Anti-immigrant organizations like FAIR, and spokesmen for FAIR like Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson, would have us believe Trump's claim that an overwhelming number of immigrants from Latin America are rapists and cartel members. Those who know the immigrant community know that this is complete hogwash. But some legislators fear making the wrong call.

Hodgson and his former segregationist friend Jeff Sessions claim the Safe Communities Act is a "sanctuary" bill that prevents immigration agents from doing their job. Sessions, like Hodgson, even wants to arrest mayors of cities who won't deputize their police as ICE agents.

But nobody's stopping ICE from doing its work. The Safe Communities Act now moving through committee simply says that Massachusetts taxpayers aren't picking up the tab for federal policing, and we're not going to go out of our way to deputize our police and prison officials as ICE agents. The bill also says “no” to registries of Muslims, Latinos — or anyone else on the wrong side of the president. 

Fear merchants like Tom Hodgson are hoping you won't read the legislation and will believe whatever they tell you about it. But the Safe Communities Act is 154 lines double spaced, and it’s not difficult to read or understand.

An important calculation the legislature must make when voting on "Safe Communities" is whether the risks to democracy of expanding the president's deportation machine outweigh any benefits of getting rid of what the president calls "bad hombres.” Most of the deportees we've been hearing about recently are guilty of 20 year-old DUI's and other low level offenses. Expanding a police state to go after them will have only negative consequences.

Let's leave the determination of dangerousness to local cops and DA's — and not willingly join the president's pogrom against brown people. Encourage your legislator to pass the Safe Communities Act. The quality of our democracy literally depends on more states passing courageous legislation like this.
