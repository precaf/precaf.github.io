<p><em>He who walks with wise men will be wise, But the companion of
fools will be destroyed. (Proverbs 13:20)</em></p>
<h4 id="hodgsons-great-replacement">Hodgson’s <em>Great
Replacement</em></h4>
<p>On Saturday, May 14th, 2022 an 18 year-old white supremacist in full
body armor walked into an East Side Buffalo, New York supermarket and
slaughtered ten Black people precisely because they were Black.</p>
<p>Payton Gendron left behind a 180-page manifesto citing the <a
target="_blank" href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf"><em>Great
Replacement</em></a> – a conspiracy theory which holds that Liberals and
mainly Jews (“globalists” or the “new world order”) are intent on
replacing white people with compliant mongrel races who reproduce at
higher rates. “This crisis of mass immigration and sub-replacement
fertility,” Gendron wrote, “is an assault on the European people that,
if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and
cultural replacement of the European people.”</p>
<p>For white supremacists, the end of white domination is as frightening
as death. Though whites dominate government, courts and commerce, the
fears of white supremacists have nevertheless magnified into nightmares
of “white genocide” and “replacement” and are found not only in the
manifestos of mass-murderers but in mainstream Republican political
dogma.</p>
<p>And this includes Bristol County’s white supremacist sheriff, Thomas
M. Hodgson.</p>
<p><em>Replacement</em> was the theme of a 1973 novel by French
nationalist Jean Raspail, a book that has captured the imagination of
American white supremacists like Steve <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-camp-of-the-saints-immigration_n_58b75206e4b0284854b3dc03">Bannon</a>,

the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2022/05/17/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained">Identitarian</a>
movement, and a considerable number of anti-immigration and white
supremacist organizations – three to which Bristol County Sheriff Thomas
M. Hodgson has close ties and all of which flog the narrative of the
<em>Great Replacement</em>.</p>
<p><img src="raspail-malkin.jpg" /></p>
<p>Raspail’s <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2022/05/17/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained">Le
Camp des Saints</a></em> was first published in 1973, <a
target="_blank" href="https://ia804603.us.archive.org/33/items/jean-raspail-the-camp-of-the-saints-1994/Jean%20Raspail%20-%20The%20Camp%20of%20the%20Saints%20(1994).pdf">translated</a>
into Englsh two years later and distributed by the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43021217-the-camp-of-the-saints">Social
Contract Press</a> (more on this Tanton group later). The publisher
described the book’s theme: “By the year 2000 there will on present
projections be seven billion people swarming on the surface of the
Earth. And only nine hundred million of them will be white.” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/a/jean-raspail-2/the-camp-of-the-saints/">Kirkus
Reviews</a> noted the book’s inherent fascism: “The publishers are
presenting <em>The Camp of the Saints</em> as a major event, and it
probably is, in much the same sense that <em>Mein Kampf</em> was a major
event.”</p>
<p>Inspired by Raspail, in 2012 another French writer, Renaud Camus (no
relation to Albert Camus), popularized the “<em>Great Replacement</em>”
theory in a self-published novel by the same name, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25179572-le-grand-remplacement-suivi-de-discours-d-orange"><em>Le
Grand Remplacement</em></a>. Camus also penned <em>You Will Not Replace
Us</em>, an <em>homage</em> to the American Alt-Right, and Tweeted: “the
genocide of the Jews was undoubtedly more criminal but still seems
somewhat small compared to global [white] replacement.”</p>
<p>In fact, <em>le grand remplacement</em> dates back at least to the
Thirties when the expression was used by Nazi French collaborator <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.juancole.com/2022/05/replacement-considered-americans.html">Rene
Binet</a>, whose brigade ended up (I’m not making this up) in charge of
defending Hitler’s bunker. An <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/grand-remplacement-trois-precedents-avant-renaud-camus-6086130">article</a>
from <em>radioFrance</em> notes that the phrase was probably used even
earlier to characterize slave revolts in Haiti and Martinique, as well
as to disparage Jews around the time of the Dreyfus affair.</p>
<p>While never truly defeated, Western fascism has been making a bit of
a come-back. France’s <em>Rassemblement National</em>, Germany’s
<em>Alternative für Deutschland</em>, England’s <em>British National
Party</em>, Hungary’s <em>Fidesz</em>, and Spain’s <em>Vox</em> all wrap
themselves in the same white Christian nationalism and anti-democratic
authoritarianism that now characterize the American Republican Party.
And all are preoccupied with “invasion” or “replacement” by non-white
immigrants. It is no coincidence that the American Conservative Union’s
CPAC Convention took place in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.conservative.org/events/">Hungary</a> this year.
Fusing pan-European <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identitarian_movement">Identitarianism</a>
and resurrected fascism with good old-fashioned American white supremacy
has long been a project of extremists like Steve <a
target="_blank" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/20/the-nationalist-internationale-is-crumbling-steve-bannon-eastern-europe-hungary-czech-republic-slovakia-trade/">Bannon</a>.</p>
<p>But white supremacy cannot succeed without maintaining white
Christian privilege and white numerical superiority, at least in the
voting booth. Laws and maneuvers privileging white Christians, limiting
immigration for non-whites, maintaining police control over largely
non-white communities, preventing the diminution of the “white race” by
abortion, and ensuring white election advantage – all are methods of
delaying the inevitable loss of white supremacy.</p>
<h4 id="the-tanton-network">The Tanton Network</h4>
<p>Spike Lee’s film <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> opens with an unhinged
racist, Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard, standing in front of a screen as D.W.
Griffith’s <em>Birth of a Nation</em> is projected onto his face.
Beauregard laments the halcyon days when Anglo-Saxons were unchallenged
masters of the nation, and he repeats several times, “We had a great way
of life.” Today that lost “great way of life” has become a dog whistle
for white supremacists and anti-immigrant groups who want to “make
American great again” by making it white again.</p>
<p><img src="kennebrew.jpg" /></p>
<p>Beauregard may be a fictional character, but <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/john-tanton">John
H. Tanton</a> was not. Tanton was a Michigan ophthalmologist who
single-handedly created a network of over a dozen white supremacist and
anti-immigrant groups, half of which the Southern Poverty Law Center
describes as hate groups.</p>
<p>The three best-known are: the Federation for American Immigration
Reform (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/">FAIR</a>), a lobbying and
action group with great influence within the Trump administration; the
Center for Immigration Studies (<a target="_blank" href="">CIS</a>); and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.numbersusa.com/">NumbersUSA</a>, all of which produce
dubious anti-immigration reports and statistics. Tanton also created the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thesocialcontract.com/">Social Contract Press</a>,
which first published <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>.</p>
<p>Thomas Hodgson sits on <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/about-fair/board-directors">FAIR’s National
Board of Advisors</a> and has appeared at anti-immigrant events
sponsored by both FAIR and CIS.</p>
<p><img src="fair-advisors.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="federation-for-american-immigration-reform">Federation for
American Immigration Reform</h3>
<p>Though they might sugar-coat it a bit, FAIR’s mission is the
preservation of Anglo-Saxon dominance from rapacious hordes of
non-white, non-English speakers who threaten to replace white Christians
and destroy America, thanks to the subversive efforts of globalists and
socialists.</p>
<p>Once mainly an anti-immigration lobbying group, during Trump’s
presidency FAIR became <a
target="_blank" href="https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/mb9nb3/fair-trump-white-house-federation-for-american-immigration-reform">deeply
embedded</a> in his administration. MediaMatters notes that the
mainstream media often cites FAIR’s untrustworthy “statistics” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/cnn/cnn-turns-anti-immigrant-hate-group-fair-immigration-commentary">indiscriminately</a>.
The Libertarian CATO Institute <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cato.org/blog/fairs-fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-study-fatally-flawed">slams</a>
FAIR’s studies and statistics as “fatally flawed” and “sloppy.”</p>
<p>FAIR’s legal wing, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irli.org/electoral-process-integrity">Immigration
Reform Law Institute</a>, formerly headed by Kris Kobach, provides legal
assistance to anti-immigrant groups. In recent years IRLI has dabbled in
disenfranchising voters of color based on the claim that “illegals” are
risking everything to throw elections for Democrats by voting
illegally.</p>
<p>FAIR’s founder John Tanton <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/news/article/ties-between-anti-immigrant-movement-and-eugenics">expressed</a>
the organization’s mission most clearly: “I’ve come to the point of view
that for European-American society and culture to persist requires a
European-American majority, and a clear one at that.” And when Tanton
spoke of “Europeans” he <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/witan-memo-iii">meant</a>
whites: “As Whites see their power and control over their lives
declining, will they simply go quietly into the night? Or will there be
an explosion?”</p>
<p>George Washington University’s Gelman Library <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2010/06/10/fair-files-founder-proposed-%E2%80%98european-american-defense%E2%80%99-group">contains</a>
a repository of letters between Tanton and Otis Graham, a close friend
of Tanton who helped him launch and run FAIR in the 1980s and who served
as a board member of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Tanton
and Graham wanted to create what they called a “League for
European-American Defense, Education and Research.”</p>
<p>In 1991 Tanton and Graham took great interest in KKK leader David
Duke’s campaign for the Louisiana governorship and were encouraged by
Duke’s founding of the National Association for the Advancement of White
People: “[T]here is a lot going on out there on the cultural and ethnic
(racial) difference” [front], Tanton wrote. Appealing to racists was
ultimately going to be “all tied to immigration policy. At some point,
this is going to break the dam.”</p>
<p>FAIR, then, was created to mirror Duke’s approach and promote <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2010/06/10/fair-files-founder-proposed-%E2%80%98european-american-defense%E2%80%99-group">white
interests</a>: “There is currently no socially acceptable umbrella
organization to which persons of European ancestry can belong to defend
and promote their common interests,” Tanton wrote. “Absent such an
organization in a highly organized society, European-Americans will
continue to see their history rewritten, their character and
accomplishments denigrated, and their faults magnified. They will
steadily lose ground and position to other groups… For those not
resigned to this gradual or not so gradual decline, a new organization
tailored to the needs and interests of European-Americans as a group is
essential.”</p>
<p>As a proponent of eugenics, Tanton also argued for <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/federation-american-immigration-reform">sterilization</a>
of the “lesser” races: “Do we leave it to individuals to decide that
they are the intelligent ones who should have more kids? And more
troublesome, what about the less intelligent, who logically should have
less? Who is going to break the bad news to less intelligent
individuals, and how will it be implemented?”</p>
<h3 id="dan-stein">Dan Stein</h3>
<p>FAIR’s current <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/dan-stein">president</a>
is Dan Stein, who often <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/2018/09/travels-hodgson-2/">coordinates</a>
media appearances and travel for Bristol County Sheriff Thomas
Hodgson.</p>
<p><img src="stein-2014.jpg" /></p>
<p>In a 1997 interview with “Alt-Right” darling Tucker Carlson, Stein <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/news/article/activists-with-extremist-ties-behind-oregon-immigration-referendum">claimed</a>
that Latino refugees arriving in the U.S. are godless, low-IQ haters:
“Immigrants don’t come all church-loving, freedom-loving, God-fearing
[…] Many of them hate America, hate everything that the United States
stands for. Talk to some of these Central Americans. Should we be
subsidizing people with low IQs to have as many children as possible,
and not subsidizing those with high ones?”</p>
<p>For Stein. immigration is a matter of maintaining white political
power. He <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/1991_times_union-danstein-competitivebreeding.pdf">worries</a>
about a power shift attending newer waves of immigration. “It’s almost
like they’re getting into competitive breeding,” Stein said in 1991.
“You have to take into account the various fertility rates in designing
limits on immigration.”</p>
<p>In addition to Stein’s views on recent immigrants, FAIR’s president
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.salon.com/2016/12/06/fairs-big-play-onetime-fringe-group-hopes-to-drive-donald-trumps-immigration-policy/">indulges</a>
in a conspiracy theory that invokes the same villains responsible for
the <em>Great Replacement</em>: “I blame ninety-eight percent of
responsibility for this country’s immigration crisis on Ted Kennedy and
his political allies, who decided some time back in 1958, earlier
perhaps, that immigration was a great way to retaliate against
Anglo-Saxon dominance and hubris, and the immigration laws from the
1920s were just this symbol of that, and it’s a form of revengism…”</p>
<h3 id="center-for-immigration-studies">Center for Immigration
Studies</h3>
<p>Like FAIR, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) was founded by
John Tanton and publishes <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/fudging-facts-look-cis-studies">questionable</a>
reports on immigration. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center,
CIS maintains <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/02/meet-jessica-vaughan-anti-immigrant-movement%E2%80%99s-representative-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-senate-judiciary">extensive
links</a> to white supremacist and antisemitic groups. In 2017 the
Southern Poverty Law Center <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/05/23/more-occasional-crank-2012-times-center-immigration-studies-circulated-white-nationalist">documented</a>
2,012 occasions on which CIS circulated white nationalist content.</p>
<p>CIS Executive Director <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/what-do-about-haiti-mark-krikorian/">Mark
Krikorian</a>, who first worked at FAIR, quipped after the deadly 2010
Haitian earthquake: “My guess is that Haiti’s so screwed up because it
wasn’t colonized long enough.”</p>
<p><img src="vaughan-hodgson.jpg" /></p>
<p>Jessica Vaughan, CIS Director of Policy Studies, may be the
organization’s best known face – and certainly well-known to Hodgson,
with whom she has appeared repeatedly. Vaughan is well spoken and
comfortable testifying before Congressional subcommittees. Still, as the
Anti-Defamation League <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/news/article/examples-of-racism-from-the-anti-immigrant-movement-in-2014">reports</a>,
Vaughan had no misgivings in April 2014 when she gave an interview to an
antisemitic newspaper, the American Free Press, founded by Holocaust
denier Willis Carto.</p>
<h3 id="hodgson-goes-to-work-for-fair-and-cis">Hodgson goes to work for
FAIR and CIS</h3>
<p>In 2011, According to FAIR’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je2OlEEsU64">annual report</a>,
the organization began cultivating sheriffs like Hodgson. “In 2011, we
identified sheriffs who expressed concerns about illegal immigration.”
FAIR staff “met with these sheriffs and their deputies, supplied them
with a steady stream of information, established regular conference
calls so they could share information and experiences, and invited them
to come to Washington to meet with FAIR’s senior staff. We invited
sheriffs who played the most prominent roles in addressing illegal
immigration locally to FAIR’s national talk radio event, <em>Hold their
Feet to the Fire</em>, where they shared their stories and expertise
with listeners across the country.” Since roughly that time Hodgson has
been a FAIR spokesman.</p>
<p>In July 2014 Hodgson visited the Rio Grande on a trip organized by
FAIR’s National Field director, Susan <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.progresstimes.net/2014/07/25/northern-sheriffs-get-close-up-look-at-border-crisis/">Tully</a>,
who reported: “What we’re doing down here in the Rio Grande Valley is
all about public education of our law enforcement officials so that they
can see exactly what is going on along the border.”</p>
<p><img src="tully-hodgson.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation league already regarded Tully as a conspiracy
theorist. She claimed, with no proof, that four million immigrants were
granted amnesty in 1986 and – again <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/blog/fairs-susan-tully-promotes-bigotry-and-conspiracies-on-radio-show">invoking</a>
the <em>Great Replacement</em> – charged the Obama Administration with
running school buses across the border to provide free K-12 education
for Mexicans. The SPLC tracked Tully’s involvement in organizing a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/02/11/anti-immigrant-flyers-distributed-nebraska-town-voting-today-housing-ordinance">racist
housing ban</a> on immigrants in Fremont, Nebraska in which she called
immigrants “invaders.” And, for organizing purposes, Tully <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/profiles-20-nativist-leaders">simply
made up</a> the “fact” that Illinois has more “illegal aliens” than
California. Tully has also been involved with an Oregon anti-immigration
group with extensive <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/news/article/activists-with-extremist-ties-behind-oregon-immigration-referendum">militia
and white supremacist</a> links.</p>
<p>When FAIR National Advisory Board member Richard Lamm said that “new
cultures” in the U.S. are “diluting what we are and who we are,” he
didn’t mean just Latinos but Muslims as well. Susan <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/racist-anti-immigration-ads-denounce-republicans-and-democrats">Tully</a>
clarified Lamm’s remarks: “They are not coming here to become
Americans,” she said. Rather, Muslims are “promoting colonization of
their own religion, of their own culture in towns and taking them
over.”</p>
<p>Tully has been spreading hate <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191129094109/https://ocweekly.com/fairs-anti-immigrant-extremist-behind-ocs-anti-sanctuary-state-revolt-has-oc-roots-2/">since
2002</a> for FAIR. In one interview with radio host Phil Valentine at a
2006 FAIR event in Tennessee, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/04/06/fair-bringing-anti-immigrant-talk-radio-hosts-dc">Tully
claimed</a> that a Border Patrol agent in Laredo, Texas described
arresting the same man seven times. Tully said she asked the agent,
“What do you do on the eighth time?” and Valentine interjected: “Shoot
him!” Tully laughed and the FAIR crowd cheered.</p>
<p>In March 2015 <a
target="_blank" href="https://wbsm.com/events-new-bedfordfall-river/immigration-forum-with-sheriff-thomas-m-hodgson/26-march-2015-united-fishermans-club/">Hodgson
appeared with Tully</a> at the Fisherman’s Club in New Bedford. He has
appeared at most of FAIR’s “Hold their Feet to the Fire” events
coordinated by Tully, most recently in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Roxp8p2UVg">2016</a>, <a

<p><img src="hodgson-fair.jpg" /></p>
<p>In 2016 Hodgson was one of three speakers at a “Patriots Unity Day”
rally in Randolph. The second speaker was Jessica Vaughan of CIS. The
third speaker was Raymond Hanna from the anti-Muslim hate group ACT for
America which also maintains <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/act-for-america">white
supremacist</a> ties. ACT and FAIR have strong connections — and Tully
figures into all of them. In 2016 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/IdahoACT/videos/568529083332197/">Tully
spoke</a> at an ACT for America event in Idaho. ACT for America also
happens to have a Nazi problem. In Arkansas ACT’s “March Against
Shariah” events were organized by a Nazi and publicized on <a

<p>On March 28, 2017 Hodgson testified with CIS Director of Policy
Studies Jessica <a

Rios</a>. Malkin too has links to white supremacist groups, including
VDARE, as well as to Islamophobic groups. <a

course, Malkin is also a <a

fan</a> of both John Tanton and <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>.</p>
<h3 id="fair-board-of-advisors">FAIR Board of Advisors</h3>
<p>Over the years Hodgson has maintained numerous associations with
Muslim-bashers, Anti-semites, gay-bashers, Birthers, and every variety
of conspiracy theorist — many of them members of FAIR’s National
Advisory Board. In November 2017 Hodgson <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/about-fair/board-directors">joined</a> that
board.</p>
<p>When asked if his board membership might be construed as endorsement
of his colleagues’ views, or at least be poor judgment on his part,
Hodgson <a
target="_blank" href="https://politicalresearch.org/2020/10/13/new-englands-joe-arpaio">bristled</a>:
“I’m on a Board of Advisors. I go once a year to listen.”</p>
<p>But Hodgson is too modest. In 2014 the sheriff was not listening but
<em>speaking</em> to FAIR’s National Board of Advisors when he conducted
a two-hour dinner discussion on “The Effect of the President’s Decisions
on DACA and its Impact on Our Law Enforcement Challenges.” In 2016
Hodgson participated in the National Board’s “Sanctuary Cities and Law
Enforcement” roundtable with Putman County, NY Sheriff Donald Smith and
FAIR’s Law Enforcement Relations Manager, Robert Najmulski. Half an hour
later, FAIR Media Director Ira Mehlman gave a talk entitled “Soros
Hacked: The Truth Behind His Big Money Network to Destroy U.S.
Borders.”</p>
<p><img src="hodgson-2016.jpg" /></p>
<p>Hodgson was present for Mehlman’s analysis of materials that <a
target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/291486-thousands-of-soros-docs-released-by-alleged-russia-backed-hackers/">Russian
hackers</a> had stolen from Soros’ <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/2017-08/September2016_IR.pdf">Open
Society Institute</a>, which Mehlman caled a “shadowy foundation” with a
“globalist agenda” to attack U.S. immigration policy. But “globalist” is
often white supremacist code for “Jewish” and FAIR, as we will shortly
see, has an axe to grind with Soros not only because he is a liberal
philanthropist, but also because he is a liberal Jew.</p>
<p>Besides Hodgson, some of FAIR’s National Board members include:</p>

<h3 id="islamophobia">Islamophobia</h3>
<p>Although Hodgson swims with racists, Birthers, and antisemites, If
there is one group to which he has more connections than any other, it
is Muslim bashers.</p>
<p>In 1998 Hodgson was among the first group of municipal public safety
officials to attend a four-day conference in Leesburg, Virginia on
<em>Strengthening the Public Safety Response to Terrorism</em>. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/congress/1998_h/3-21-98trevino.htm">conference</a>
was organized by the International Association of Fire Chiefs in
conjunction with the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance and brought
together police and fire chiefs from most metropolitan areas of the
United States.</p>
<p>In an interview Hodgson said: “We were down there for four days to
learn about this new thing that was coming onto our doorstep if we —
Actually we were far behind in law enforcement. Because there [were]
already people, terrorist activity long going on before that. In fact,
if you look at [Steven Emerson’s] ‘American Jihad’ which will be worth
your watching, you will see people — Muslims raising their —
<em>terrorists</em> rising their rifles, dancing in the hall above
stores in New York, saying, kill the infidels, kill the infidels. It’s
all on tape. But anyway, so my training down there, I’m thinking, OK,
you know what? This is good training, it’s good to be aware. The bag
they gave us to carry our materials had a stencil on the front of it
with the New York skyline with a target on one of the World Trade
Center.”</p>
<p><img src="terrorism.jpg" /></p>
<p>Steven Emerson’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://fair.org/extra/steven-emersons-crusade/">account</a> of
American Muslim rooftop celebrations of 9/11 in New Jersey, and Donald
Trump’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/">recollections</a>
of the same have both been discredited. But Hodgson is drawn to
self-anointed terrorism and Islam “experts” regardless how unreliable
their information or their memory.</p>
<p>In 2015 Hodgson appeared with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/journal-sun/2015/05/06/filmmaker-to-speak-on-immigration/34618187007/">Dennis
Michael Lynch</a> at Ahavath Torah Congregation in Stoughton,
Massachusetts, a synagogue run by Rabbi Jonathan Hausman – another
self-appointed national security expert. Hausman’s temple had previously
hosted Dutch neo-fascist and Islam hater <a
target="_blank" href="https://forward.com/news/353234/clergy-protest-anti-islam-speakers-at-boston-synagogue/">Geert
Wilders</a>. Over 100 members of the clergy, including other rabbis,
protested a similar <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/11/01/faith-leaders-sound-alarm-about-critics-islam-appearing-stoughton-synagogue/7FdpW8CTD7O9TGjQP4W3eL/story.html">hate
fest</a> the synagogue hosted the following year featuring Muslim-basher
<a
target="_blank" href="https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-frank-gaffney/">Frank
Gaffney</a> and Christian nationalist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/8/9/1118236/-Jerry-Boykin-Islamophobe-and-dominionist-is-now-2-at-Family-Research-Council">Jerry
Boykin</a>. When asked about Hodgson’s talk with Hausman, he explained
he was just there doing his duty to inform the public about terrorism:
“They asked me to come speak about terrorism. That’s what they asked me
to do. So I was I was to speak with them. […] I was asked — I was
invited to go there to speak. That’s why I was there, because of my my
involvement with the terrorism task force.”</p>
<p>Lynch’s film, “They Come to America,” was reviewed by the <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210403020240/https://www.adl.org/blog/new-documentary-portrays-negative-view-of-immigration-in-the-us">Anti-Defamation
League</a>. “In the documentary, Lynch travels the country interviewing
people about undocumented immigration. Lynch talks to figures from
anti-immigrant groups such as NumbersUSA and the Federation for American
Immigration Reform [both Tanton groups]. Lynch also interviews Glenn
Spencer of the anti-Hispanic hate group American Border Patrol.”</p>
<p>Like Hodgson, Lynch is a supporter of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/constitutional-sheriffs-cops-who-think-government-our-greatest-threat-n557381">Constitutional
Sheriff Movement</a>. In 2014 Lynch made a fawning documentary about
sovereign citizen rancher <a
target="_blank" href="https://gemstatepatriot.com/blog/trial-cliven-bundy/">Cliven
Bundy</a> and in 2016 his bid for <a
target="_blank" href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/dennis-michael-lynch-ends-presidential-run">president</a>
was so off-the-wall that the GOP stood clear. Lynch routinely <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-friends/fox-discredited-anti-immigrant-filmmaker-triples-number-undocumented-immigrants-us">exaggerates</a>
the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States,
claims that the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-relies-discredited-anti-immigrant-filmmaker-attack-immigration-rally">Chinese</a>
are sneaking across the Mexican border in order to inflict a “cyber 911”
on the U.S., and that <a
target="_blank" href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/dennis-michael-lynch-isis-america">ISIS</a>
is bringing terrorists into the U.S. via Mexico. This is exactly what we
hear from Hodgson.</p>
<p>In 2018, Hodgson appeared on FOX News with Bernard Kerik, <a
target="_blank" href="https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/5750070990001#sp=show-clips">claiming</a>
that in 2015 MS-13 had ordered its members to expand the gang’s presence
on Nantucket. Both claimed that MS-13 was recruiting in island high
schools. The supposed metastasis of MS-13 in New England has been one of
Hodgson’s favorite themes. Yet, as violent and grisly as the gang’s
occasional handiwork is, MS-13 membership is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/12/12/all-but-eradicated-attorney-says/ODIj16BXqOOYD3P0etoOON/story.html">down
dramatically</a>. In fact, in 2018 the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts,
Andrew Lelling, said that “we have all but eradicated MS-13 in the
Greater Boston area. We’re running out of MS-13 targets.”</p>
<p><img src="act-santa-clara-june-2017.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another Islamophobic group that Hodgson is connected to, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/profile/act-america">ACT for
America</a>, was founded in 2007 by Brigitte Gabriel. It claims to have
more than 1,000 chapters around the country, and espouses the crudest
sort of anti-Muslim hate. Both the Anti-Defamation League and the
Southern Poverty Law Center have documented ACT’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/act-america">many
links</a> with antisemitic, neo-Nazi, Christian right, Identitarian, and
white supremacist groups. ACT for America sponsors anti-Muslim <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/05/anti-sharia-law-bills-united-states">legislation</a>
and organizes anti-Muslim events with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-sharia-group-with-close-ties-to-trump-has-a-nazi-problem_n_59d2a231e4b048a44324852b">neo-Nazis</a>.
ACT for America organizes around the claim that Christianity and Judaism
are under attack by Islam. Pastor Jack Hibbs and Stoughton Rabbi Jon
Hausman — whom we met earlier — were both <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?414748-4/act-america-2016-conference-part-4">speakers</a>
at ACT’s 2016 “Religious Persecution” conference in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>In July 2007 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2011/anti-muslim-inner-circle">Gabriel</a>
spoke at the Annual Convention of Pastor John Hagee’s Christians United
for Israel (CUFI): “The difference, my friends, between Israel and the
Arabic world is quite simply the difference between civilization and
barbarism. It’s the difference between good and evil and this is what
we’re witnessing in the Arab and Islamic world. I am angry. They have no
soul! They are dead set on killing and destruction.”</p>
<p>Perhaps because of its far-too-frequent neo-Nazi connections, ACT for
America became too toxic for even Donald Trump. Following an article in
the Miami Herald announcing <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article235830792.html">ACT’s
gala</a> at Mar-a-Lago, which was to have been headlined by Michelle
Malkin (another friend of Hodgson’s), the Trump administration had
second thoughts: “[The gala] will absolutely not be taking place at
Mar-a-Lago,” a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article235855202.html">spokeswoman</a>
for the Trump Organization announced.</p>
<p>ACT might have been too toxic for Trump — but not for Hodgson and his
friends from FAIR and CIS. In September 2016 the sheriff appeared at a
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/journal-sun/2016/09/27/norfolk-county-republicans-to-host/25280047007/">Republican
unity rally</a> in Norfolk county attended by his old friend Jessica
Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies and by ACT for America’s
Ray Hannah.</p>
<p>In <a
target="_blank" href="https://americasvoice.org/blog/who-attended-feet-to-the-fire-act-2018/">2018</a>
Hodgson and Brigitte Gabriel appeared again at FAIR’s “Hold their Feet
to the Fire” event in Washington DC. And on September 26th both Hodgson
and Gabriel attended FAIR’s <a

“Hold their Feet to the Fire” event.</p>
<h3 id="antisemitism">Antisemitism</h3>
<p>In 2015 Hodgson joined American Family Association’s governmental
affairs director and FOX News contributor Sandy Rios on her radio show
at the U.S. Capitol. Rios claims that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/sandy-rios-says-secular-jews-have-been-the-worst-enemies-of-the-country/">secular
Jews</a> have been the worst enemy of the country, that “so many of the
Jews in this country are atheist” and “sometimes turn out to be<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_RpyH8B194&amp;feature=youtu.be">the
worst enemies of the country</a>.”</p>
<p>Hodgson has had a long acquaintance with Rios, having appeared with
her regularly at FAIR’s annual “Hold their Feet to the Fire” events. In
2017 Hodgson appeared at one with Rios, Michelle Malkin and FAIR’s Dan
Stein. Rios’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://afr.net/podcasts/sandy-rios-in-the-morning/2017/june/live-from-the-hold-their-feet-to-the-fire-event-with-dan-stein-michelle-malkin-and-sheriff-hodgson/">interviews</a>
were broadcast on the Christian broadcast network, American Family

target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/sandy-rios-claims-immigrants-dont-know-basic-hygiene/">told
listeners</a> that immigrants “don’t know basic hygiene.”</p>
<p>On February 10, 2019 Hodgson appeared on the <a
target="_blank" href="https://bottradionetwork.com/ministry/washington-watch/2019-02-10-sen-josh-hawley-ag-jeff-landry-fran-coombs-sheriff-thomas-hodgson/">American

State Department’s</a> <em>Ministerial to Advance Religious
Freedom</em>, a flagrant effort to make Christianity our state
religion.</p>
<p>In 2001 Stephen Steinlight of the Center for Immigration Studies –
one of the Tanton groups with which Hodgson is involved, and who <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stephen-steinlight-obama_n_5613541">suggested</a>
that Barak Obama be “hung, drawn and quartered” – wrote a <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Report/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography">report</a>
titled “The Jewish State in America’s Changing Demography.” Reflecting
the <em>Great Replacement</em> theory and virtually screaming “<em>Jews
will not replace us,</em>” Steinlight castigated secular Jews for their
historical support for liberal immigration policies, arguing that
Mexicans would soon erode Jewish political power. Steinlight offered
himself as an example of a Jew who had come to <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Report/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography">see
the light</a>, saying that his own views had been changed by CIS
Executive Director Mark Krikorian – whose remark about Haiti you are
already familiar with.</p>
<p>For FAIR and CIS, their war against the Jewish embrace of
multiculturalism has largely been a failure, and secular Jews like
George Soros who still advocate for liberal immigration have become a
bitter enemy, as seen in Media Director Ira Mehlman’s 2016 talk
following Hodgson’s at FAIR’s National Advisory Board meeting. In <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Report/High-Noon-Midnight-Why-Current-Immigration-Policy-Dooms-American-Jewry">2004</a>
Steinlight issued a call to action with an essay, “High Noon to
Midnight: Why Current Immigration Policy Dooms American Jewry” but he
still couldn’t make any progress with secular Jews. By <a
target="_blank" href="https://cis.org/Steinlight/Jewish-Establishment-Censorship-Information-Immigration-Policy">2010</a>
Steinlight was frustrated and angry at his co-religionists, accusing the
“Jewish Establishment” of censorship and repression.</p>
<h3 id="philosemitism">Philosemitism</h3>
<p>If liberal secular Jews are the “bad Jews,” then for FAIR and CIS
Israel is the “good Jew” and a model of ethno-religious nationalism in
which security and immigration are handled the “right” way. In <a
target="_blank" href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/23/israel-walls-lives/">2019</a>
FAIR’s Mehlman penned an article in the Daily Caller praising Israel’s
“separation wall.” Hodsgon has also cited <a

<p>Hodgson has not been particularly discriminating in jumping under the
political bedsheets with antisemites and crackpots. A poster boy for
this is Rick Wiles, an End Times believer and a fierce antisemite.</p>
<p>In November 2014 Hodgson appeared on <a

— the “End Times Newscast” with Rick Wiles, a conspiracy theorist who,

Hodgson</a>, advocates locking up people whose politics he disagrees
with. Wiles devoted “the first half of the program to recount several
profound prophetic dreams his family received years ago,” and in the
second half Wiles interviewed Hodgson, who discussed immigration and his
work with FAIR.</p>
<p>Among Wiles’ more deranged statements in recent years: that Obama was
inspired by <a

<p>But for Hodgson it always seems to boil down to immigration.</p>
<p>In 2018 Hodgson watchers took note when the sheriff announced with
great fanfare that the National Sheriff's Association (NSA) would be <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/2018/09/06/mass-sheriff-hodgson-leads-crowdfunding-effort-to-fund-border-wall/10832009007/">crowdfunding</a>
Trump's wall. But Hodgson's NSA project folded after raising less than
$100K in three months — despite his false claim that excessive web
traffic had crashed the site. For a time Hodgson’s old NSA site
redirected donors to a group called the American Border Foundation.</p>
<p><img src="hodgson-crowdfunding.jpg" /></p>
<p>When Hodgson began his association with the American Border
Foundation, its Director of Communications was <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201130174539/https://www.fundthewall.com/about-us/">Jeremy
Messina</a>, who identifies with the white Nationalist <em><a

movement and whose Facebook postings bore striking <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOyjXXqmbKA">similarities</a> with
the Buffalo shooter’s manifesto.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201210193116/https://www.fundthewall.com/donations/funding-the-us-border-wall-5/">American
Border Foundation</a>’s crowdfounding scheme never reached its $450
million goal. During its three-year run, ABF’s less-than 4,000 donors
raised barely over $227K. Its founder, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4yU2qk0P5c">Gary Dolan</a>, had
tried wall-building before via a FundRazr campaign that raised only
$12K. The fund's managing director, Quentin Kramer – who has ties to
FAIR sister organization AVIAC – went on the conspiracy and white
supremacist circuit trying to sell the project.</p>
<p>Kramer appeared on the far-right <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.blogtalkradio.com/southernsense/2018/11/20/build-the-wall-quentin-kramer-and-mike-cutler-join-southern-sense">Southern
Sense</a> podcast and on an “anti-federalist” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5etsUOviFY">program</a> that
frequently invokes Article IV, Sec. 4, Clause 2 of the Constitution
("the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against
Invasion...").</p>
<p>Despite lackluster donations, Hodgson <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-borderwall-business/">claimed</a>
that as a sheriff he could cut through the red tape to ensure donations
got to the Department of Homeland Security and that the wall would be
built. In November of 2018, Hodgson said he submitted a form to DHS to
donate $100,000 to pay for “border barriers on the Southern border.” But
DHS informed the American Border Foundation it could not accept the
donations.</p>
<p><img src="dhs-letter-july-12.jpg" /></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in <a

Hodgson and Kramer were still acting as if the crowdfunding effort was
still viable. Both spoke at a FAIR-AVIAC-sponsored press conference in
Washington, whose main function was to highlight the “Angel Families”
who had lost family members to auto accidents or crimes committed by
undocumented migrants.</p>
<p><img src="abf-hodgson.jpg" /></p>
<p>As of today, the whereabouts of $227,657 in ABF donations are still
unknown. Neither the ABF nor Hodgson has ever responded to information
requests from <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/bristol-county-213/communications-regarding-american-border-foundation-109251/">Bristol

<h3 id="protect-america-now">Protect America Now</h3>
<p>Hodgson’s latest project is called <a
target="_blank" href="https://protectamericanow.com/"><em>Protect America Now</em></a>,
which looks like nothing more than several God-and-Country sheriffs who
oppose immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, secularism, and
socialism. The sheriffs include: the group’s spokesman, Pinal County
(AZ) Sheriff Mark Lamb; Green County (MO) Sheriff Jim Arnott; Livingston
County (IL) Sheriff Tony Childress; Bristol County (MA) Sheriff Thomas
Hodgson; Brevard County (FL) Sheriff Wayne Ivey; Culpeper County (VA)
Sheriff Scott Jenkins; and Wicomico County (MD) Sheriff Mike Lewis.</p>
<p>Despite <em>Protect America Now’s</em> call to “stand strong against
lawlessness,” its sheriffs refuse to enforce state gun control laws or
COVID-19 mask or social-distancing <a target="_blank" href="">mandates</a>. Instead,
harkening back to the original function of American sheriffs as slave
patrols, this motley crew support <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pinal-county-sheriff-citizens-posse-program-allows-residents-to-be-deputized">arming
and deputizing</a> their mainly white county residents against “urban”
protesters and – again echoing the <em>Great Replacement</em> – border
“invaders.”</p>
<p><img src="pan.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pinal County (AZ) Sheriff Mark Lamb is the public face of <em>Protect
America Now</em> and a “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/17/us-police-far-right-capitol-attack">Constitutional
Sheriff</a>” who claimed in one speech to the Arizona Police Association
that “the constitution is hanging by a thread.” Lamb belongs to the
Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association founded by former
Arizona sheriff Richard Mack and spoke at CSPOA’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://cspoa.org/product/cspoa-2020-virginia-conference-highlight-video-download/">2020
Virginia Conference</a>. At least three other <em>Protect America
Now</em> sheriffs, Thomas <a

and Wayne <a

are also CSPOA members.</p>
<p>Contrary to <em>Protect America Now’s</em> marketing on Fox News and
elsewhere — <em>Protect America Now</em> is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/people/arizona/mark-lamb.html">not
Lamb’s creation</a>. It turns out the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/protect-america-now.html">incorporator
and director</a> of <em>Protect America Now</em> is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/opinion/allegations-of-electoral-crimes.html">Nathan
Sproul</a>, a GOP operative who has been accused of, fired for, and
charged with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-gop-paying-consultant-dogged-by-voter-fraud-charges/">multiple
counts of voter fraud</a>, and who set up <em>Protect America Now</em>
most recently in June 2020. As a sometime associate of Karl Rove,
Sproul’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.salon.com/2012/10/15/karl_rove_tied_to_shady_gop_operative_nathan_sproul/">entire
career</a> has been devoted to voter suppression and dirty tricks.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/protect-america-now-pan2.html">trademark</a>
for <em>Protect America Now</em> was created in 2004 and was the
brainchild of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dandb.com/businessdirectory/protectamericanow-glendale-az-12614304.html">Kathy
W. McKee</a>, who is still listed on a PAC <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/protect-arizona-now-committee.html">registration</a>
with a similar name. McKee was also the driving force behind a 2004
Arizona voter suppression bill, <a
target="_blank" href="https://apps.azsos.gov/election/2004/Info/PubPamphlet/english/prop200.pdf">Proposition
200</a>. As soon as McKee got Prop 200 on the ballot, the GOP and every
brownshirt and satin-sheeted group in Arizona took an interest. But
McKee made the mistake of bringing an unfiltered white supremacist, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/virginia-abernethy">Dr. Virginia
Abernethy</a>, onto the organization’s national advisory board.
Abernethy was so extreme for the rest of the racists that the Federation
for American Immigration Reform removed Abernethy and took control over
PAN to save Prop 200, despite <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/ignoring-its-own-ties-anti-immigration-group-denounces-white-separatist">previous
support</a> for Abernethy.</p>
<p>The lawyer who incorporated <em>Protect America Now</em> for Sproul
is Kory Langhofer, an equally <a
target="_blank" href="https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-campaign-lawyer-caught-using-his-business-partner-as-witness-in-sharpiegate-case/">ethically-unencumbered</a>

Arizona election results</a> for Trump. <em>Protect America Now</em> and
Langhofer’s offices share a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rnla.org/korylanghofer">common address</a>. Langhofer
is also the co-owner of <a
target="_blank" href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/291866-signafide-promises-funnel-suspect-signatures">Signafide</a>,
a company that uses AI to challenge ballot signatures.</p>
<p>As the GOP increasingly embraces nativism, the extremists have gone
mainstream. The innvolvement by high level GOP operatives like Nathan
Sproul and Kory Langhofer using sheriffs like Hodgson and their
dangerous militia and white supremacist connections says a lot about the
party’s transformation.</p>
<p>Not so very long ago it was racists and xenophobic extremists who
worked behind the scenes to support the GOP. Now it’s the Republican
Party operating behind the scenes to support the extremists.</p>
<h3 id="confederate-ties">Confederate Tie(s)</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago, someone noticed that an archived page from the
Bristol County Sheriff’s Department featured an official portrait of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/11/sheriff-hodgson-confederacy-tie">Hodgson
wearing a Confederate necktie</a>. Howard Graves, a research analyst
with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), recognized Hodgson’s tie as
an “Old South Confederate Necktie” which resembles the Confederate
battle flag and is sometimes called an Anglo-Confederate society tie.
Graves added, “Many people affiliated with the broader neo-Confederate
movement wear that tie either in necktie or bowtie form.” Mark Pitcavage
with the Anti-Defamation League, agreed: “The tie in the photograph
seems certainly to be derived from the design of the Confederate
flag.”</p>
<p>Despite everything you’ve read so far, Hodgson vehemently denies his
sly tip of the hat to the Confederacy. “They know I would not be wearing
anything that makes me the poster boy for bigotry.”</p>
<p><img src="necktie.jpg" /></p>
<p>Hodgson’s spokesman provided an even more flaccid defense – that
Hodgson “has never heard of neo-confederates or anglo-Confederate
societies or anything like that.”</p>
<p>Despite the faux outrage and feigned innocence, in the last 24 years
Bristol County voters have had ample time to observe a sheriff who
openly advocates for white supremacy and rubs elbows with
neo-Confederates and neo-Nazis. In fact, there is no one in Bristol
County who qualifies better than Hodgson as a poster boy for
bigotry.</p>
<p>It’s time for voters to finally send this companion of fools into
retirement in November.</p>
