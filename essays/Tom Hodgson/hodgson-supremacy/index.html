<h3 id="is-tom-hodgson-a-white-supremacist">Is Tom Hodgson a white
supremacist?</h3>
<p><em>If not, he would have resigned from this ugly crew of satin
sheets and brown shirts long ago</em></p>
<p>Bristol County (MA) Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson has built a career as a
cruel jailer on top of allying himself with white supremacists.</p>
<p>In 1999 Hodgson visited Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s “Tent City” — a
facility for Hispanic detainees that Arpaio <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7reZOp2Qco">himself</a> called a
“concentration camp,” where inmates lived in 120-degree heat the desert
in surplus tents <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/donald-trump-far-right-joe-arpaio">from
the Korean War</a> and received half-rations of barely-edible food.
Hodgson, who enthusiastically adopted Arpaio’s methods, joked to a
Boston Herald reporter, “it’s not a buffet here.” After returning to
Massachusetts, Hodgson increasingly modeled his own practices after
Arpaio’s and even began using Arpaio’s tag line: “jail is not a country
club.” And following the footsteps of Arpaio, who in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maricopa-county-criticizes-dhs-over-arpaio-immigration-report">2016</a>
lost access to his 287(g) ICE program because of systematic violations
of constitutional and human rights of his inmates, Hodgson <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/20/ice-close-two-detention-centers">lost
his</a> own 287(g) program in 2021 for all the same reasons — cruelty
and incompetence.</p>
<p>After September 11, 2001 Hodgson had realized the financial potential
of collaborations with the Department of Homeland Security. With massive
amounts of money being thrown around to protect the “Homeland,” Hodgson
easily received $3.2 million from DHS to build the C. Carlos Carreiro
immigration center in 2007, which later became a full-fledged ICE
detention facility. He also received federal money for a $250K DHS
command center van — now used primarily for Fourth of July parades and
public relations.</p>
<p>In 2011 an organization created by a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2008/09/19/tanton-files-fair-founder’s-racism-revealed">white
supremacist</a> optometrist named <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/john-tantons-network">John
Tanton</a> began recruiting sheriffs to do its dirty work. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/2017-08/FAIR_2011AnnualReport.pdf">2011
Annual Report</a> of the Federation for American Immigration (FAIR) —
which both the Southern Poverty Law Center (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/john-tantons-network">SPLC</a>)
and the Anti-Defamation League (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/the-anti-immigrant-movement-in-the-us">ADL</a>)
regard as a hate group — began using county sheriffs as spokesmen to
oppose (and in many cases to flaunt) national and state immigration and
gun control laws. Hodgson was one of the first to sign up. Working with
a FAIR organizer named <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191129094109/https://ocweekly.com/fairs-anti-immigrant-extremist-behind-ocs-anti-sanctuary-state-revolt-has-oc-roots-2/">Susan
Tully</a> who both the SPLC and the ADL had long been monitoring,
Hodgson organized a “fact finding” mission to McAllen, Texas in July
2014. Since then Hodgson has attended dozens of FAIR’s conferences and
events, including its “Hold their Feet to the Fire” broadcast events
that draw speakers from a variety of allied hate groups. In March 2015
<a
target="_blank" href="https://wbsm.com/events-new-bedfordfall-river/immigration-forum-with-sheriff-thomas-m-hodgson/26-march-2015-united-fishermans-club/">Hodgson
appeared with Tully</a> at the Fisherman’s Club in New Bedford and he
has appeared at most of FAIR’s “Hold their Feet to the Fire” events
coordinated by Tully (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Roxp8p2UVg">2016</a>, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Roxp8p2UVg">2017</a>, <a
target="_blank" href="https://americasvoice.org/blog/who-attended-feet-to-the-fire-act-2018/">2018</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB5giuktCaQ">2019</a> and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/issue/border-security/hold-their-feet-fire-2021">2021</a>).</p>
<p>By 2014 Hodgson was on FAIR’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.fairus.org/about-fair/board-directors">National Board
of Advisors</a> and was “educating” the American Right to the dangers of
even DACA recipients. In one of his many trips to Washington DC paid for
by Massachusetts taxpayers, on October 11, 2014 <a
target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HylDWf5A99vo0ufNZZxJRSc8tq-LY9WE/view">Hodgson
spoke</a> to fellow FAIR National Board of Advisors on “The Effect of
The President’s Decisions on DACA and Its Impact on Our Law Enforcement
Challenges.” On September 24, 2016 Hodgson again spoke to FAIR’s
National Advisors. The topic this time was “Sanctuary Cities.” Hodgson’s
dinner talk immediately preceded one about Jewish “Big Money” and the
plot to “Destroy U.S. Borders.” FAIR’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/is-hodgson">National Board of
Advisors</a> is a virtual Who’s Who of conspiracy nuts, anti-Semites,
racists, Neo-Confederates, Muslim bashers, white supremacists,
eugenicists, and Christian Identitarians.</p>
<p>In <a
target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HylDWf5A99vo0ufNZZxJRSc8tq-LY9WE/view">October
2015</a> Hodgson again visited the “Rio Grande” — this time with Robert
J. Sylvia, then one of Hodgson’s top brass but now retired, who was all
set to run for Sheriff in next month’s election but managed to file his
ballot signatures on the wrong form. The sheriffs and their entourage
toured the border but also went 70 miles out of their way to visit the
ranch of <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181207101638/http://imagine2050.newcomm.org/2015/09/24/fair-border-summit-to-introduce-sheriffs-nationwide-to-border-vigilante-group/">Mike
and Linda Vickers</a>, founders of the vigilante group Texas Border
Volunteers, an offshoot of the Minuteman Project, a loose-knit group of
vigilantes, some of whom are affiliated with White supremacist militias
and have been linked to both <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minutemen-member-on-trial-in-murder-of-girl-9/">murders</a>
and incidents like the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/new-mexico-militia.html">illegal
detention</a> of hundreds of migrants in April 2019.</p>
<p>Besides FAIR, Hodgson is also involved with another Tanton group —
the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). SPLC does not categorize CIS
as a hate group, but CIS functions as a disinformation and lobbying
group with extensive white supremacist and antisemitic links. It is led
by Mark Krikorian, who first worked at FAIR and who once said about
Haiti: “My guess is that Haiti’s so screwed up because it wasn’t
colonized long enough.” The group’s most visible face is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/02/meet-jessica-vaughan-anti-immigrant-movement’s-representative-tomorrow’s-senate-judiciary">Jessica
Vaughan</a>, who used the antisemitic newspaper <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/news/article/examples-of-racism-from-the-anti-immigrant-movement-in-2014">American
Free Press</a>, founded by Holocaust denier Willis Carto, to flog CIS
talking points — as did Hodgson’s fellow FAIR national advisor Frosty
Wooldridge. On March 28, 2017 Hodgson testified with CIS Director of
Policy Studies Jessica <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?426090-1/lawmakers-spar-immigration-policy-enforcement-hearing">Vaughan</a>
at Border Security and Immigration Enforcement hearings in Washington.
He also appeared with Vaughan at a CIS-organized event in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/2017/05/24/local-news/panel-sets-out-make-case-against-sanctuary-cities-massachusetts">Boston</a>
the following month, and another in <a
target="_blank" href="https://newbostonpost.com/2017/05/25/counter-resistance-to-sanctuary-cities-forms-in-boston/">West
Roxbury</a> the month after that. In <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/2020/01/usual-suspects/">January 2020</a>
Hodgson again appeared with Vaughan (a resident of South Carolina)
before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland
Security. <a
target="_blank" href="https://bccjustice.org/2020/01/usual-suspects/">FAIR-AVIAC</a>
also sent two others to testify before Massachusetts legislators.</p>
<p>In 2015 Hodgson appeared with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/journal-sun/2015/05/06/filmmaker-to-speak-on-immigration/34618187007/">Dennis
Michael Lynch</a> at Ahavath Torah Congregation in Stoughton,
Massachusetts, a synagogue run by Islamophobe rabbi Jonathan Hausman.
Hausman had previously hosted Dutch Neo-fascist and Islam basher <a
target="_blank" href="https://forward.com/news/353234/clergy-protest-anti-islam-speakers-at-boston-synagogue/">Geert
Wilders</a>. Over 100 members of the clergy, including other rabbis,
protested a similar <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/11/01/faith-leaders-sound-alarm-about-critics-islam-appearing-stoughton-synagogue/7FdpW8CTD7O9TGjQP4W3eL/story.html">hate
fest</a> the synagogue hosted the following year featuring Muslim-basher
<a
target="_blank" href="https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-frank-gaffney/">Frank
Gaffney</a> and Christian nationalist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/8/9/1118236/-Jerry-Boykin-Islamophobe-and-dominionist-is-now-2-at-Family-Research-Council">Jerry
Boykin</a>. When I asked Hodgson about his talk with Hausman and Lynch,
Hodgson said with a straight face that he was just there doing his duty
to inform the public about terrorism: “They asked me to come speak about
terrorism. That’s what they asked me to do. […] That’s why I was there,
because of my my involvement with the terrorism task force.”</p>
<p>In 2015 Hodgson joined American Family Association’s “governmental
affairs director” and FOX News contributor Sandy Rios on her radio show
at the U.S. Capitol. Rios claims that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/sandy-rios-says-secular-jews-have-been-the-worst-enemies-of-the-country/">secular
Jews</a> have been the worst enemy of the country, that “so many of the
Jews in this country are atheist” and “sometimes turn out to be <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_RpyH8B194&amp;feature=youtu.be">the
worst enemies of the country</a>.” It was not the first time Hodgson
ignored the anti-Semites he was rubbing elbows with. His involvement
with the Jew-bashing Tanton group is no aberration. In November 2014
Hodgson appeared on <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/trunews/wednesday-november-26-2014">TruNews</a>
— the “End Times Newscast” with Rick Wiles, a conspiracy theorist and
anti-Semite who claimed that Obama was inspired by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/rick-wiles-barack-obama-is-personally-orchestrating-a-satanic-sedition-against-president-trump/">Lucifer</a>
and killed Supreme Court Justice <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/rick-wiles-obama-killed-scalia-as-a-pagan-human-sacrifice/">Scalia</a>
as a pagan human sacrifice, that the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/rick-wiles-says-irgun-has-kill-teams-in-america/">Irgun</a>
has kill teams all over America, and that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/rick-wiles-jews-will-use-red-flag-laws-to-disarm-christians-and-kill-them/">Jews</a>
will use gun control laws to kill Christians. Wiles devoted “the first
half of the program to recount several profound prophetic dreams his
family received years ago” and the second half to Hodgson, who discussed
immigration and his work with FAIR.</p>
<p>In 2016 Hodgson was one of three speakers at a “Patriots Unity Day”
rally in Randolph. The second speaker was Jessica Vaughan. The third
speaker was Raymond Hanna from the anti-Muslim hate group ACT for
America which also maintains <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/act-for-america">white
supremacist</a> ties. For example, in Arkansas ACT’s “March Against
Shariah” events were organized by a Nazi and publicized on <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-sharia-group-with-close-ties-to-trump-has-a-nazi-problem_n_59d2a231e4b048a44324852b">Stormfront</a>.
Perhaps because of its far-too-frequent neo-Nazi connections, ACT for
America was too toxic for even Donald Trump. Following an article in the
Miami Herald announcing <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article235830792.html">ACT’s
gala</a> at Mar-a-Lago, which was to have been headlined by Michelle
Malkin (another friend of Hodgson’s), the Trump administration had
second thoughts: “[The gala] will absolutely not be taking place at
Mar-a-Lago,” a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article235855202.html">spokeswoman</a>
for the Trump Organization announced. In September 2016 the sheriff also
appeared at a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/journal-sun/2016/09/27/norfolk-county-republicans-to-host/25280047007/">Republican
unity rally</a> in Norfolk county attended by his old friend Jessica
Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies and by ACT for America’s
Ray Hannah.</p>
<p>In June 2017 Hodgson appeared with Dan Stein and Michelle Malkin at
an annual “Hold Their Feet to the Fire” broadcast with anti-gay bigot <a
target="_blank" href="https://afr.net/podcasts/sandy-rios-in-the-morning/2017/june/live-from-the-hold-their-feet-to-the-fire-event-with-dan-stein-michelle-malkin-and-sheriff-hodgson/">Sandy
Rios</a>. Malkin has links to white supremacist groups, including
several Tanton groups and VDARE, as well as to Islamophobic
organizations. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/18/malkin-anchor-baby-policy-ultimate-magnet-illegal-aliens/">Malkin</a>
opposes the 14th Amendment, which gave citizenship to slaves. And, of
course, Malkin is also a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_30_1/tsc-30-1-malkin.shtml">big
fan</a> of both John Tanton and <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>, a
racist book that has attained almost scriptural reverence among
believers in the <a
target="_blank" href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf">Great
Replacement</a>, a conspiracy theory that maintains that White people
are being consciously replaced and outnumbered by immigration sponsored
and financed by Liberals and Jews — a view shared by the 18 year-old
white supremacist who marched into a Buffalo supermarket in full body
armor last May and murdered ten Black people.</p>
<p>In 2018 Hodgson announced with great fanfare that the National
Sheriff’s Association (NSA) would be <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/2018/09/06/mass-sheriff-hodgson-leads-crowdfunding-effort-to-fund-border-wall/10832009007/">crowdfunding</a>
Trump’s wall. But Hodgson’s NSA project folded after raising less than
$100K in three months — despite a false claim that excessive web traffic
had crashed the site. The NSA site redirected donors to a group called
the American Border Foundation, whose Director of Communications was <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201130174539/https://www.fundthewall.com/about-us/">Jeremy
Messina</a>, who identifies with the white Nationalist <a
target="_blank" href="https://i0.wp.com/bccjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alt-right.jpg?resize=624%2C402&amp;ssl=1"><em>Identitarian</em></a>
movement and whose Facebook postings bore striking <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOyjXXqmbKA">similarities</a> with
the Buffalo shooter’s manifesto. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201210193116/https://www.fundthewall.com/donations/funding-the-us-border-wall-5/">American
Border Foundation</a>’s crowdfunding scheme never reached its $450
million goal. During its three-year run, ABF’s less-than 4,000 donors
raised barely over $227K. The fund’s managing director, Quentin Kramer —
who like Hodgson has ties to FAIR through FAIR’s sister organization
AVIAC — went on the conspiracy and white supremacist circuit trying to
sell the project. For example, Kramer appeared on the far-right <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.blogtalkradio.com/southernsense/2018/11/20/build-the-wall-quentin-kramer-and-mike-cutler-join-southern-sense">Southern
Sense</a> podcast and also on an “anti-federalist” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5etsUOviFY">program</a> that
frequently invokes Article IV, Sec. 4, Clause 2 of the Constitution
(“the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against
Invasion…”).</p>
<p>Despite lackluster donations, Hodgson <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-borderwall-business/">claimed</a>
that as a sheriff he could cut through the red tape to ensure donations
got to the Department of Homeland Security and that the wall would be
built. In November of 2018, Hodgson claimed he had submitted a form to
DHS to donate $100,000 to pay for “border barriers on the Southern
border.” But DHS informed the American Border Foundation it could not
accept their donation. Nevertheless, in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/21/while-congress-dallies-coalition-ready-to-write-check-for-border-security-its-not-trumps-wall-its-americas-wall/">2019</a>
Hodgson and Kramer were still acting as if the crowdfunding effort was
still viable. Both spoke at a FAIR-AVIAC-sponsored press conference in
Washington, whose main function was to highlight the “Angel Families”
who had lost family members to auto accidents or crimes committed by
undocumented migrants. As of today, the whereabouts of $227,657 in ABF
donations are still unaccounted for. Neither the ABF nor Hodgson has
ever responded to information requests from <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/bristol-county-213/communications-regarding-american-border-foundation-109251/">Bristol
County for Correctional Justice</a> or <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.americanoversight.org/document/foia-to-dhs-regarding-border-wall-crowdfunding-efforts">American
Oversight</a>.</p>
<p>Hodgson’s newest project is <em>Protect America Now</em>. Once again,
Hodgson is not just a member: he’s on Protect America Now’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://protectamericanow.com/leadership/">national advisory
board</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface, PAN’s <a

like another collection of uber-patriotic, God- and gun-waving <a

seizing voting machines</a>.</p>
<p>Besides his leadership role in PAN, Hodgson is also a member of
CSPOA; in 2014 his membership dues were recorded by the Massachusetts <a
target="_blank" href="https://ocpf.us/">Office of Campaign and Political
Finance</a>.</p>
<p>In June, PAN spokesman, Pinal County (AZ) Sheriff Mark Lamb,
announced the creation of an “election integrity” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.truethevote.org/protectamerica-vote-citizens-and-sheriffs/">project</a>
that will funnel reports (no doubt as ridiculous as those from Rudy
Guiliani and Sydney Powell) to sheriffs for “quick evaluation of
incoming information.” And at the FreedomFest 2022 conference in Las
Vegas CSPOA founder <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irehr.org/2022/07/09/cspoa-to-boost-sheriffs-election-fraud-project-at-freedom-fest/">Richard
Mack</a> announced that sheriffs would seize voting machines. Lamb,
Hodgson’s fellow advisor at Protect America Now, recently <a
target="_blank" href="https://boltsmag.org/true-the-vote-sheriffs/">teamed up</a> with
True the Vote’s Catherine Engelbrecht, who was already working with the
CSPOA. Lamb has promised to investigate so-called “ballot mules” — a
reference to the Big Lie movie “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-usa-mules-idUSL2N2XJ0OQ">2000
Mules</a>” by Dinesh D’Souza, who was convicted on <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dinesh-dsouza-convicted-felon-pardoned-by-trump-has-done-some-vile-things_n_5b1007efe4b05ef4c22bbf94">felony
charges</a> of using “straw donors” to make illegal campaign donations
but was later pardoned by Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This is the world Hodgson not only lives in but has chosen to create.
Whether Hodgson himself is a white supremacist — or has simply built a
career by supporting white supremacists for decades — is a trivial
distinction.</p>
<p>Hodgson is either a monster or a fool. In neither case does he
deserve to be returned to his job as Bristol County Sheriff.</p>

<p>Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson is a member of the <a
