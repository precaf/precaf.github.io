<p>The National Sheriff’s Association — the organization that represents rogue sheriffs like Sam Page, David Clarke, and Tom Hodgson and which celebrates the abuses of Customs and Border Patrol officers — has a soft spot for animals. Yes, the NSA <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sheriffs.org/AnimalCrueltyGateway">actually endorsed legislation</a> on animal cruelty, arguing that there is a link between animal cruelty and cruelty to humans. And we would not disagree.</p>
<p>But the sheriffs didn’t seem to appreciate the irony of defending puppies while torturing humans in the county jails they themselves operate.</p>
<p>Not to be out-done by the sheriffs’ hypocrisy, Donald Trump signed the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/animal-cruelty-felony-president-trump-signs-animal-cruelty-pact-act-bill-making-it-a-federal-felony-2019-11-25/">Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act</a> (PACT) last month, giving rights to animals that he refuses to extend to Central American children in his concentration camps.</p>
<p>But concern for animal rights while simultaneously showing indifference to human suffering is also a feature of Massachusetts law.</p>
<p>Massachusetts has animal cruelty statutes which provide for up to seven years in prison for the abuse of animals. In 2016 the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heraldnews.com/news/20190628/westport-animal-activists-let-down-by-sentences-in-tenant-farm-cruelty-case">Attorney General charged ten people</a> with the mistreatment of over a thousand animals on a farm in Westport. All were allowed to plead guilty and serve probation, which outraged animal rights groups. When it comes to humans, the AG’s office has a civil rights division but has not similarly intervened in behalf of prisoners suffering and dying in the state’s jails.</p>
<p>The rights of dogs and cats in the Commonwealth have a leg up — actually four legs up — on the rights of their human counterparts. According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter140/Section137C">Massachusetts General Laws</a>, Part I, Title XX, Chapter 140, Section 137C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The mayor of a city, the selectmen of a town, the police commissioner in the city of Boston, a chief of police or an animal control officer may at any time inspect a kennel or cause the inspection of a kennel. If, in the judgment of such person or body, the kennel is not being maintained in a sanitary and humane manner or if records are not properly kept as required by law, such person or body shall, by order, revoke or suspend the license for the kennel.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s right. Kennels may be freely inspected by public officials if conditions are believed to be unsanitary or inhumane. This is a right that not even state legislators have in Massachusetts “corrections” facilities.</p>
<p>For dogs, state law likewise regulates confinement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No person owning or keeping a dog shall chain or tether a dog for longer than 5 hours in a 24–hour period and outside from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., unless the tethering is for not more than 15 minutes and the dog is not left unattended by the owner, guardian or keeper.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your eyes are not playing tricks on you. “No excessive solitary” for dogs is written into Massachusetts law — while mentally-ill Bristol County prisoners are going to have to wait for the courts to decide if the overuse of solitary confinement is legal.</p>
<p>Under Massachusetts law a dog must be given adequate space to move, and environmental considerations (heat and cold) are strictly regulated. <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter140/Section174E">Specific types of inhumane treatment</a> are prohibited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(1) filthy and dirty confinement conditions including, but not limited to, exposure to excessive animal waste, garbage, dirty water, noxious odors, dangerous objects that could injure or kill a dog upon contact or other circumstances that could cause harm to a dog’s physical or emotional health;</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>taunting, prodding, hitting, harassing, threatening or otherwise harming a tethered or confined dog; and</p></li>
<li><p>subjecting a dog to dangerous conditions, including attacks by other animals.”</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>No such protections exist for the safety and well-being of humans confined in Massachusetts jails and prisons.</p>
<p>Finally, it boggles the mind that “inhumane” is the word chosen by people to describe mistreatment of animals — but not of fellow humans who “deserve what they get” in prisons that “are not country clubs.”</p>
<p>But there is a solution. By simply re-designating jails as “kennels” — a name change prison rights advocates point out <em>already</em> describes the inhumane conditions in state prisons and jails — <em>human</em> prisoners in Massachusetts will finally receive the legal rights their four-legged friends already have.</p>
