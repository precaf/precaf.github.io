<p>Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson must be feeling the stinging
criticisms of his substandard jail food, his systematic violations of
human rights, his suicides, his recidivism rate, and his refusal to help
inmates deal with drug addiction.</p>
<p>After 24 years in office, only <em>this week</em> – barely a week
before an election that could well unseat him – Hodgson announced to
great fanfare that he had scored a “perfect score” on his <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newbedfordguide.com/bristol-sheriffs-office-perfect-score-opioid-treatment-audit-earns-independent-national-accreditation/2022/11/02">opioid
treatment program</a> from the National Commission on Correctional
Health Care, joining his “perfect score” from the American Corrections
Association.</p>
<h4
id="aca-certifications-not-worth-the-paper-theyre-printed-on"><strong><em>ACA
Certifications not worth the paper they’re printed on</em></strong></h4>
<p>Readers of this newsletter are aware that <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/sham-accreditations">ACA
certifications are not worth the paper they’re printed on</a>. As
Senator <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Accreditation%20Con%20-%20December%202020.pdf">Elizabeth
Warren</a> found when investigating them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The ACA accreditation process is a rubber stamp</strong>. It
is almost impossible for a facility to fail an ACA audit. The ACA grants
facilities three months’ advance notice of audits; provides facilities
with “technical assistance,” including “standards checklists” and an
“audit readiness evaluation” that help a facility know when to schedule
its audit and what to expect; and, at a facility’s request, will conduct
a “mock audit” to help the facility prepare.4 If problems persist
despite these ample opportunities to correct—or hide—them, the ACA
Commissioners can ignore audit finding altogether and allow a facility
that failed its audit to receive accreditation, rendering these
standards toothless.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="ditto-ncchc-certifications"><strong><em>Ditto, NCCHC
certifications</em></strong></h4>
<p>It turns out that the <strong>NCCHC certifications are equally
meaningless</strong>. A 2016 article in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/jul/6/betraying-promise-accreditation-quis-custodiet-ipsos-custodes/">Prison
Legal News</a> showed that the NCCCH misrepresents the stringency of its
“inspections.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Like the ACA, <strong>the NCCHC warns prison officials of upcoming
inspections but claims they also conduct unannounced reviews</strong>.
Also like the ACA, the NCCHC has historically relied on self-reported
information from the facilities it accredits.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the ACA, the NCCHC is an opaque organization with too many
interests in private prison licensure, and it’s little more than a
<em>pay-to-play scheme</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Both the ACA and NCCHC are also plagued by conflicts of interest,
including the fact that <strong>they effectively sell
accreditation</strong> to their correctional colleagues and promulgate
their own voluntary standards with no oversight.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with the ACA, the NCCHC frequently gives “perfect scores” to
institutions that habitually violate the constitutional rights of their
inmates. But don’t believe <em>me</em>. Believe the Department of
Justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Civil Rights Division issued
a letter in April 2008 that found the Worcester County Jail and House of
Correction in Massachusetts had <strong>unconstitutional conditions of
confinement</strong>. Specifically, the jail failed to protect detainees
from harm, failed to protect them “from exposure to unsanitary and
unsafe environmental conditions,” and did not provide detainees with
adequate mental health care. <strong>County officials rejected the
allegations, noting the facility was accredited by both the ACA and
NCCHC – which, in light of the DOJ’s findings, indicates the inadequacy
of accreditation</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PLN <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/jul/6/betraying-promise-accreditation-quis-custodiet-ipsos-custodes/">article</a>
goes on to recount horror stories at the Idaho Correctional Center,
where inmates were subjected to “gladiator school” beatings while
corrections staff did nothing to intervene. It mentions the Walnut Grove
Youth Correction facility in Mississippi where young people were
sexually abused and subjected to high levels of violence. It mentions a
Federal Bureau of Prisons facility in Texas where prisoners were given
substandard medical care. It lists a number of mental health abuses at
jails in Texas, Utah, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, and others – <strong>all
where NCCHC certifications papered over the abuses, giving the
institutions either “perfect” or passing scores</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2009 – only after the Department of Homeland Security had revoked
Maricopa County’s Joe Arpaio of his 287(g) program – did the NCCHC
revoke Arpaio’s certifications that had previously given his facilities
glowing reports. A facility that Arpaio himself called a “concentration
camp.”</p>
<h4

“First in the Nation” drug treatment program</em></strong></h4>
<p>In the same <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newbedfordguide.com/bristol-sheriffs-office-perfect-score-opioid-treatment-audit-earns-independent-national-accreditation/2022/11/02">self-congratulatory
press release</a> announcing his NCCHC “perfect” score, Hodgson went a
step further, announcing a drug treatment program in collaboration with
Correctional Psychiatric Services (CPS), Hodgson’s healthcare vendor – a
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepaidjailer.org/">major donor to his
campaign</a>.</p>
<p>In another <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newbedfordguide.com/bristol-county-sheriffs-office-treatment-gap-first-nation-inmate-reentry-clinic/2022/11/01">press
release</a>, Hodgson described his outpatient drug treatment program as
the “brainchild” of CPS president Jorge Veliz and a “first-in-the-nation
inmate reentry clinic.” Of course it is nothing of the sort. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/sheriff-cocchi-opioid-stabilization-and-treatment-centers-to-open-in-springfield-ludlow/">Hampden
County</a> Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi has been operating a similar program
for four years in conjunction with the Department of Corrections – which
ought to be running all county jails. Another Hodgson lie.</p>
<h4 id="but-why-now"><strong><em>But why now?</em></strong></h4>
<p>One wonders why it took Hodgson 24 years – other than facing stiff
campaign opposition – to take an interest in medically assisted [drug]
treatment. In 2019 Hodgson fielded questions from community members at
the last 287(g) hearing he ever conducted. In this <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHqvqZM27cs">clip</a> Hodgson
whines that administering MAT treatments to inmates is “controversial,”
can take up to 10 minutes, and who has the time for that? Nope, all
Hodgson’s going to do is give them a <em>spritz</em> of vivitrol and
wish them good luck on the way out of jail.</p>

<h4 id="cps-is-part-of-the-problem"><strong><em>CPS is part of the
problem</em></strong></h4>
<p>Besides the recidivism and suicides, and the many reports of medical
neglect, Hodgson’s jail leads in jail deaths. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cpshealthcare.org/">CPS</a> has not only presided over
the administration of substandard mental health services to inmates;
since 2020 there has been clear evidence that it provides demonstrably
bad medical care.</p>
<p>In October 2020 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/">Reuters</a>
released a national comparison of jail deaths. Bristol County again was
#1 on the wall of shame:</p>
<p><img src="deaths.png" /> <em>From Reuters data</em></p>
<p><strong>Roughly one out of 500 detainees in the Bristol County Jail
ends up dead compared to less than one per thousand in most other
jails</strong>.</p>
<p>Dr. Jorge Raul Veliz, the owner and president and founder of
Correctional Psychiatric Services, has a staff of about 200 and
contracts with Dukes, Bristol, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk
county jails in Massachusetts and has contracts in Pennsylvania, New
York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maine. His employees are not
unionized. Veliz founded CPS in 1994, co-founded Boston Clinical
Consulting (a Guatemalan healthcare company) in 2007, and in 2009
co-founded the Hospital Psiquiatrico Mederi in Guatemala.</p>
<p>In 2017 Barnstable County <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/politics/county/2017/07/13/county-jail-to-reduce-nursing/20270073007/">downsized</a>
its nursing staff, outsourcing care to Correctional Psychiatric
Services. Within weeks, there were <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/22/inmate-suicides-barnstable-county-jail-prompt-investigation/jx8a8vV120IJD7mxWVJs0H/story.html">two
suicides</a> at the Barnstable County jail. Before CPS services even
started work, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/opinion/columns/2017/07/21/health-care-in-jail-shouldn/20083770007/">Barnstable
nurse</a> Hillarie Gaynor Clarke penned a prescient warning of the risks
of using CPS: “I strongly urge the Barnstable County Sheriff’s Office to
reconsider CPS as an ally, based on its blatantly poor and sometimes
fatal track record. Unfortunately, at this rate, it seems that inmate
care will only worsen at our county correctional institution.”</p>
<p>CPS employees have been accused repeatedly of medical neglect by both
local and ICE detainees. One <a
target="_blank" href="https://imm-print.com/nobody-should-endure-the-negligence-that-i-experienced-i-do-not-want-this-to-happen-to-anyone-else/">report</a>
from a California-based immigration group details a case of medical
neglect by CPS. A search of nursing licenses for the four caregivers
mentioned in the complaint showed one with an Associate Degree in
Nursing from Laboure College, another with an LPN from Lindsey Hopkins
Technical College, another with a vocational certificate from Diman
Regional Vocational Technical High School – all supervised by a Nurse
Practitioner from the University of Louisville, who only saw the patient
after the worst neglect had already occurred.</p>

profile of CPS, the detailed account of medical neglect by an ICE
detainee which names CPS employees by name, a presentation on suicide by

<h4 id="conflicts-of-interest---the-paid-jailer"><strong><em>Conflicts
of Interest - “The Paid Jailer”</em></strong></h4>
<p>Besides CPS’s dismal record as a medical and mental health services
provider, voters ought to be very skeptical of CPS’s involvement in
Hodgson’s latest public relations con.</p>
<p>In January 2022 Common Cause released a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.commoncause.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CC_PaidJailer_WEB_FINAL.pdf">report</a>,
“The Paid Jailer,” which looks at the role of campaign donations to
sheriffs by their vendors. Not surprisingly, the report starts with the
Bristol County sheriff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In Bristol County, Massachusetts, more than 30 people have died
behind bars in the last 10 years. Overwhelmingly, these are people
awaiting trial. Some have died because of substance withdrawal and
others by suicide. And <strong>the people who remain incarcerated say
that they’re not receiving basic health care</strong>, including one man
in Bristol County who has given us permission to share his story
anonymously…</p>
<p>Yet Thomas M. Hodgson, the longtime sheriff of Bristol County and the
sole leader of the jail facility, has made no changes to the health care
provider, CPS Healthcare. <strong>CPS has spent more than $20,365 on
sheriffs’ campaigns in Massachusetts, and $12,040 has gone directly to
Hodgson</strong>. The State of Massachusetts reports that state sheriffs
paid a total of $9.82 million in contracts to CPS Healthcare from 2012
to 2021. Hodgson appears to be the rule, rather than the exception,
which we show in The Paid Jailer: How Sheriff Campaign Dollars Shape
Mass Incarceration…”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="final-thoughts"><strong><em>Final thoughts</em></strong></h4>
<p>Hodgson’s operation is a nightmare. For both inmates and taxpayers.
On November 8th voters have a chance to replace death, neglect,
starvation, lawsuits, and lies with a sheriff with experience in
corrections who takes corrections seriously. Paul Heroux will reform and
professionalize a cruel, corrupt, hyper-politicized, patronage-based
operation with data-driven programs that actually rehabilitate
incarcerated people.</p>
<p>And after all, that’s all Massachusetts sheriffs are
<em>supposed</em> to do.</p>
