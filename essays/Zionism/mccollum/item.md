*Finally*. [For the first time *ever*](https://972mag.com/palestinian-rights-make-a-rare-appearance-in-congress/130697/) someone in Congress is doing something about Israel's systematic abuse of Palestinian children — abuses that include torture and incarceration of kids as young as eight.

As Israel celebrates its 50th anniversary of land theft, martial law, and human rights abuses on Palestinians, Democratic Minnesota Congresswoman [Betty McCollum](https://mccollum.house.gov/media/press-releases/mccollum-introduces-legislation-promote-human-rights-palestinian-children) quietly filed [H.R.4391](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4391), the *Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act*, which prevents U.S. tax dollars from supporting the "Israeli military’s ongoing detention and mistreatment of Palestinian children." The bill has twelve [cosponsors](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4391/cosponsors), all of them progressive Democrats.

H.R.4391 has been endorsed by the American Friends Service Committee, [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/) USA, Center for Constitutional Rights, Churches for Middle East Peace, Defense for Children International - Palestine, [Friends Committee on National Legislation](https://www.fcnl.org/updates/end-systematic-abuse-of-palestinian-youth-in-israeli-military-detention-1142), Global Ministries of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and United Church of Christ, [Jewish Voice for Peace](https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/congresswoman-mccollum-introduces-first-ever-legislation-support-palestinian-human-rights/), Mennonite Central Committee, Presbyterian Church (USA), the [U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights](https://uscpr.org/campaigns/end-child-detention/), United Methodists for Kairos Response (UMKR), and United Methodist General Board of Church and Society.

**Read about it.**

The progressive Jewish magazine +972 features a number of articles on [Children Under Occupation](https://972mag.com/special/children-under-occupation/). 

**Do something about it.** 

Sign a petition, write, call, or email your Congressman and ask them to co-sponsor H.R.4391.

[Take action](https://uscpr.org/campaigns/end-child-detention/)

**And remember.**

When midterm elections come around, [check](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4391/actions) if your Congressman cared enough to try to end child incarceration and torture.

If not, *why* are you supporting him?
