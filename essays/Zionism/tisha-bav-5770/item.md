[![Destruction of the temple](9avpic1.jpg "Destruction of the temple")](9avpic1.jpg)

_Tisha b'Av_ recalls the destruction of both temples. It is a time for reflection, reading the _[Book of Lamentations](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm)_, and thinking about the darker human impulses which are said to have led to these historical calamities.

As always, a number of thoughtful essays have appeared on the internet. Some predictably hammer away the theme of Jewish power over powerlessness, or beat the drum for war against external powers of darkness, while others recognize that darkness exists in our own souls and that this is a time for reflection and re-prioritization.
