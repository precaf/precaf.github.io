Dear JStreet, 

I read your Iran policy this morning. I was momentarily buoyed by your measured remarks "that the immediate imposition of harsher sanctions on Iran would be counterproductive." This appears to be the same position that APN has, and one I completely agree with. But further down in your statement you ominously add "the full range of options should always be available when considering possible US responses to any future Iranian threats or provocations." 

The "full range of options" can only mean only one thing: support for war. 

The only "Iranian threats or provocations" so far have been Holocaust denial and the insistence on the right to pursue its own nuclear program (like Israel, India, or Pakistan). We may not like Holocaust denial, but is it a provocation? 

It seems to me that the only provocation thus far has been Israel's. Israel was the party that conducted a simulated attack on Iran last year. Israel was the one to send its navy up and down the Suez canal earlier this year. Israel is the nation which keeps making remarks about "when" to bomb Iran, not "if." 

Just as Iraq was "unfinished business" for many neoconservative, Iran is as well. How many wars are we going to permit neoconservatives to get us into? 

I would like to see JStreet come out strongly against any kind of attempt by Israel or its American neoconservative friends to draw the United States into an Iran war. This, unfortunately, is the direction we are already heading. Already, most significant American Jewish organizations have been enlisted to support this coming war and JStreet should be a voice of sanity resisting efforts that serve only one purpose: to preserve Israel's nuclear hegemony, not to protect it from some supposed "existential threat" -- a threat that Ehud Barak has denied. 

Please sharpen your message of opposition to any American support or participation in a war against Iran. We don't need to be embroiled in any more wars.

> 
> J Street believes that an Iran with nuclear weapons, especially one that continues to support terrorist groups, would present a major threat to Israel, American interests, and a challenge to peace and stability in the Middle East. 
> 
> The Unites States and Israel have a clear interest in preventing Iran from possessing nuclear weapons. The international community equally shares an interest and responsibility in ensuring that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapons capability. 
> 
> We believe that an effective policy on Iran demands a comprehensive and multilateral approach. The United States needs to reach out to its international partners. J Street applauds the efforts of President Obama to engage the European Union, Russia and China, and other members of the international community in developing a common strategy on the question of Iran¹s nuclear program. 
> 
> J Street believes that US policies should be designed with the aim of influencing Iran's decision-makers to arrive at an outcome that is in line with the above goals. 
> 
> We strongly support President Obama¹s efforts to engage in a diplomatic dialogue with Iran as the most effective means to achieving that outcome. That policy of dialogue needs to be combined with diplomatic pressure and the possibility of further economic sanctions. Diplomatic engagement should not be open-ended. But a policy of strategic patience and caution is required. Political "posturing" and the setting of artificial deadlines in our view hinders diplomacy. 
> 
> J Street believes that the immediate imposition of harsher sanctions on Iran would be counterproductive. The hardliners in Iran have a long and successful track-record in manipulating the threat of sanctions to bolster their own position. At a time when the hardliners are in some disarray, the imposition of tougher sanctions by the United States may allow them to consolidate their hold on power, and only serve to alienate large sectors of the Iranian population. 
> 
> We do not rule out the option of deeper and more targeted sanctions in the future. But to be most effective, any policy of sanctions requires broad international support and needs to be seen as supporting, and not replacing, diplomatic efforts. Endangering the unity of the international coalition by pursuing unilateral American or narrow "coalition of the willing" enhanced sanctions is likely to prove counterproductive and allow Iran to more effectively play off different actors in the international community against one other. 
> 
> J Street, like most Americans, was inspired by the Iranian people's struggle for democracy. We were outraged by the violent crackdown of the Iranian regime on the peaceful demonstrations by the Iranian people for the upholding of their democratic rights. The US Government should play a behind-the-scenes role in supporting outreach to open channels of communication with Iranian civil society.

> J Street believes that the full range of options should always be available when considering possible US responses to any future Iranian threats or provocations.

> But at this time we urge Congress and the President to exercise strategic patience. We ask Congress not to move forward at this time with further sanctions and we are strongly opposed to any consideration at this time of the use of military force by Israel or the United States to attack Iran's nuclear infrastructure.
