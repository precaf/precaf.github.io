##### One State Solution

Most of the organizations which comprise the formal [Israel Lobby](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/john-mearsheimer/the-israel-lobby), including AIPAC, WINEP, and ZOA, promote policies which are virtually identical to the [Likud's One State platform](http://www.timesofisrael.com/likud-opposed-to-a-palestinian-state-says-hardliner-mk/), which states that there will *never* be a Palestinian homeland west of Jordan. Look on a map to see what that means. AIPAC has enjoyed bipartisan support for years, even as both the GOP and DNC neglected the creation of a Palestinian state and lavished many billions of dollars on Israel. Besides formal lobbyists, there are also several American [Zionist](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Herzl) organizations that [fund settlements](http://forward.com/opinion/328952/why-are-our-federation-dollars-funding-israeli-settlements/) and, in so doing, undermine the Two State solution.

##### No-State Solution

There's no arguing with the fact that America has a lot of anti-Semites. This week the neo-Nazi friends of Richard Spencer and Steve Bannon are planning an [armed march to terrorize Jewish families](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-12-19/neo-nazi-website-daily-stormer-targets-jews-in-whitefish-montana) and businesses of Whitefish, Montana. For most of us, however, like former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart who was referring to pornography, we know anti-Semitism when we see it.

But Israel managed a linguistic coup by [extending the definition](http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm) of anti-Semitism to include any criticism of Israel. Organizations that once fought and illuminated hatred of Jews now find themselves spending a lot of time enmeshed in Israeli foreign and domestic policy. They claim to support the Two State solution but argue that only because of anti-Semitism and recalcitrance do Palestinians have "no state" and deserve none for the time being – until Israel's "security" needs are satisfied.

##### Two-State Solution

The majority of American Jews want a Two State solution and it's not hard to see why. The One State solution means either (1) expelling all Arabs (something Defense Minister [Avigdor Lieberman](http://972mag.com/this-election-libermans-racism-is-going-mainstream/101456/) has advocated and which [half of Israelis support](http://www.timesofisrael.com/plurality-of-jewish-israelis-want-to-expel-arabs-study-shows/)); (2) depriving Palestinians of a state, civil laws and rights, squeezing them into reservations or *bantustans*, and subjecting them to endless [checkpoints](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/israeli-checkpoints-live-colonisation-151129073339365.html); or (3) inviting Palestinians into the Israeli state. Israel has backed itself into a corner with decades of "annexation" and there's hardly anything left for Palestinians. Occupation is all it knows. Israel could also embrace (4) the American "Indian reservation" model and [unilaterally declare](http://newrepublic.com/article/112617/israel-palestine-and-end-two-state-solution) encircled "cantons" a "Palestinian" homeland. I fear this option would satisfy most Americans because – it seems to have worked nicely for us.

American Jews and progressive Israelis see both the moral danger and the self-destructive effect of leaving nothing for Palestinians. Consequently many American Jewish organizations support the Two State Solution:
