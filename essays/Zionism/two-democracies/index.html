<p>Most Americans still think of Israel as the “little country that
could” – what Israelis call their “startup nation.” Some fondly recall
the <em>kibbutzim</em> or the old Labor governments,
liberal-<em>ish</em> but not really all that liberal and certainly not
democratic — at least for those in Arab villages inside and outside
Israel’s borders. But since the 1967 war Israel has moved quite far to
the right and has had a succession of right-wing governments. Over the
years the U.S. has pumped over $150 <em>billion</em> into its economy,
dedicated, at least in part, to maintaining a ethno-religious state many
liken to South African <em>Apartheid</em>.</p>
<p>The 37th government of Israel, formed at the very end of 2022 and led
by Smotrich, Ben Gvir, and Netanyahu, is the most right-wing of all
time. It’s so extreme that Israel’s apologists now have an almost
impossible job of defending the nation’s illiberal and openly racist
policies. Liberal Israelis are <em>alarmed</em> by authoritarianism now
directed against <em>them</em> and by religious extremism that now seeks
to marginalize <em>them</em>. 28% are considering leaving the country.
Tech companies (many of which are registered in Delaware) and some
physicians are relocating. Both Smotrich and Ben Gvir openly call for
murdering and expelling Palestinians. A settler now under arrest for
murder in a pogrom on a Palestinian village once worked for an extremist
Member of the Knesset who praises him as a hero.</p>
<p>All this is so <em>over-the-top</em> that a completely different
response is required from the United States. And when I say “over the
top” I mean: what’s happening today exceeds the routine mistreatment and
deprivation of human rights that Israel has inflicted for 75 years on a
population almost its own size — realities the U.S. ignores as it
dishonestly claims to support a “Two-State Solution” — now impossible
because of the colonization of the West Bank by over 650,000
settlers.</p>
<p>As enablers of Israel’s occupation and illegal settlements, U.S.
administrations have complained unconvincingly that they have no real
leverage with Israel. But the United States has always had both carrots
and sticks. “Tough love” for Israel does not necessarily mean
dismantling US-Israel military cooperation or slapping sanctions on a
state that is arguably doing some of the same things to Palestinians
that Russia is doing to Ukrainians. It <em>could</em> involve stopping
the annual billions in subsidies (which even progressive Israelis are
calling for). It <em>might</em> entail altering diplomatic status or
pulling our embassy out of a colonized Jerusalem. It <em>might</em> be
voting in the UN Security Council for or against resolutions condemning
mistreatment of Palestinians on the basis of desired policy choices by
Israel. Or it <em>might</em> take the form of rewarding Israel with
economic deals (particularly in the tech, energy, and security sectors)
when – <em>and not until</em> – Israel fully withdraws from the West
Bank. That is, if the U.S. <em>really</em> wants to see a Two State
Solution.</p>
<p>Speaking of economic development, a current focus for both Joe Biden
and Benjamin Netanyahu is making the Saudi-Israeli deal a reality. It’s
to the personal political advantage of both to make the deal happen.
Netanyahu is fighting to regain control of a coalition in which he’s now
in the minority, and to stay out of jail on corruption charges. Biden is
trying to score points with the American Right and Center. Supporting
this effort, Hakeem Jeffries was in Israel recently with the Israeli
lobby group AIPAC, which has been spending a lot of PAC money on
attacking Democrats. Jeffries’ goal was apparently to send a message to
an American Right that loves ethno-religious nationalism: <em>Biden
hasn’t given up on Israel</em>. In fact, there’s a never-ending
procession of Democratic supplicants arriving in Israel on either AIPAC
or state and city-funded junkets. This week it was New York’s Democratic
mayor Eric Adams seeking an audience with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Instead of all this slavish ass kissing, Democrats <em>ought to
be</em> exerting pressure to save what’s left of Israeli democracy and
preserve the Two State option they <em>claim</em> to support – not
endorsing an extremist government led by a prime minister about to be
indicted, who was just presented with a plan from his coalition partners
to put a million settlers in the West Bank.</p>
<p>For Netanyahu, who recently had a pacemaker implanted and has poured
the last of his political, if not physical, capital into a government
built out of the old Kach movement (at one time declared a terrorist
organization and banned from Israeli politics), a Saudi-Israeli deal
could be part of his legacy — that is, if it’s not tarnished by a prison
sentence for corruption.</p>
<p>Liberal and Progressive — and even some not-so-liberal — Israelis are
begging the U.S. to show some tough love for Israel. Organizations like
ACRI (the Association for Civil Rights in Israel), the Israel Policy
Forum, Partners for Progressive Israel, even the right-of-center Shalom
Hartman Institute, and US Jewish organizations like Jewish Voice for
Peace and Americans for Peace Now are concerned about the judicial coup
now underway, which is intended to remove Supreme Court impediments to
“unreasonable” actions by an extremist government. If the judicial coup
succeeds, it will be the death of what is left of “democracy” in Israel
proper (though neither democracy nor legal redress have ever existed in
the West Bank or Gaza).</p>
<p>But that doesn’t faze Biden or Jeffries one bit. They’re playing to a
right-wing or right-of-center electorate accustomed to displays of
affection for “our unbreakable bond” with a nation whose
ethno-supremacist dynamics are precisely like our own. And when the
President invokes jingoist American exceptionalist rhetoric, calls for
God’s blessings on the nation, and cheer-leads religious-ethnic
supremacy elsewhere, it looks an awful lot like the “Lite” version of
the Christian Nationalism that suffuses GOP politics. What ever happened
to universal human rights and <em>real</em> democracy?</p>
<p>Neither Israel nor the U.S. has ever truly had a democracy <em>for
all of its people</em>. In both cases the design of our democracies has
privileged one group at the expense of deeply harming another. And now,
because both designs were so deeply flawed right from the beginning —
because neither even pretends to be a real democracy — they’re not even
working for the privileged.</p>

<p><em>I am working on another piece on the “startup nation.” In the
meantime there are some excellent <a
