<h1 class="title">Applying Pressure on Israel</h1>

<p>For those who work for peace in Israel and Palestine, there are a number of strategies for applying pressure on Israel. Divestment is one, while boycotts and sanctions are others.</p>
<h3 id="divestments">Divestments</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="ahavalondon.jpg"><img src="ahavalondon.jpg" title="ahava-london" alt="ahava-london" /></a></p>
<p>Divestments can be divided into those concerning (1) Israeli businesses based on illegal settlements (such as the well-known cosmetics line, Ahava), (2) American or international companies whose products are used for oppressive means (for example, the militarized Caterpillar tractors used to bulldoze Palestinian homes), or (3) all Israeli companies. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bdsmovement.net/">Global BDS movement</a>, for example, has demonstrated cases of companies which have been forced to move out of settlements into undisputed territory. I am generally supportive of divestments, but would caution against calls for divestment of all Israeli companies, particularly if their only crime is being a subsidiary of an international company. Of course, many of these international companies are subsidiaries of military contractors which profit enormously from continuing oppression and human suffering. This is a tricky area which needs some kind of litmus test.</p>
<h3 id="boycotts">Boycotts</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="251.jpg"><img src="251.jpg" title="251" alt="251" /></a></p>
<p>Boycotts can similarly be divided into (1) <a target="_blank" href="http://usacbi.wordpress.com/">academic, sports and cultural boycotts</a> and (2) consumer boycotts. While I have read the arguments for restricting Israeli cultural connections with the U.S., “human” boycotts punish even progressive Israeli voices – athletes who want to promote peace, non-Zionist Israeli history professors, or Israeli film makers who try to depict the truth. We have already seen in the case of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1344-2004Sep6.html">Tariq Ramadan</a>, who was denied a visa to the United States to teach for a semester, or in the case of the Israeli tennis player <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1064269.html">Shahar Pe’er</a>, how these forms of punishment can be applied to hurt individuals. I oppose punishing civilians for their government’s positions (Americans would be unable to travel anywhere if this were the case). I am opposed to any form of ideological purity tests applied to individuals, whether they are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-israel-loyalty7-2009feb07,1,6468629.story">Avigdor Lieberman’s loyalty oaths for Arabs</a>, or ways of exempting people with “correct” views from boycotts. We have had some experience with this in our own history. These were the HUAC hearings in the Fifties. I am certain this view differs from many who are working for peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="boycott-bloody-orange.jpg"><img src="boycott-bloody-orange.jpg" title="boycott_bloody_orange" alt="boycott_bloody_orange" /></a></p>
<p>Rather than limit the contact of Israelis in the United States, I would like to see the expansion of Palestinian contacts with the U.S. While <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pacbi.org/">www.pacbi.org</a> makes some valid points about the exceptionally free access that Israelis, many of them dual-nationals, have in the United States, only stepped-up cultural and political contacts with Palestinians will counteract this. We need a more free exchange of ideas, not more restrictions on them. In the case of consumer boycotts, however, I believe that Israel must feel the pinch of the world’s disapproval of its policies, so I am in favor of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/apr/13/nationalunionofjournalists.mediaunions1">boycotts of all Israeli products</a> as long as the Occupation continues. This is something that does not target an Israeli citizen individually, but is something he has the power to change.</p>
<p>I believe that, as a political tactic, a boycott must be easily explained or understood to be adopted by the public. PACBI has issued a clarification of how to consider various types of boycotts. While this is a good start, it demonstrates the complexity of explaining cultural boycotts to the public.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="340x.jpg"><img src="340x.jpg" title="340x" alt="340x" /></a></p>
<h3 id="sanctions">Sanctions</h3>
<p>Sanctions are perfectly justified, since Israel is in violation of so many international, U.S. export control, and even its own laws that we have lost count. There are many kinds of sanctions, among them: (1) military, (2) economic, and (3) diplomatic. Tactically, boycotts and divestments may distract us from concentrating on sanctions, which, to me, are the most powerful forms of demonstrating disapproval of Israel’s policies and actions. The most effective sanction we could apply is to completely withdraw all military aid from Israel. The United States has no business propping up <em>any</em> government which commits human rights abuses, whether it is in Pakistan, Egypt or Israel. For this reason, Americans must cut all military aid to Israel and eliminate economic cooperation projects, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.israel21c.org/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Articles%5El1891&amp;enPage=BlankPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enDispWhat=object&amp;enVersion=0&amp;enZone=Articles&amp;">cooperative energy programs</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="iaf-f16d-b40-israel.jpg"><img src="iaf-f16d-b40-israel.jpg" title="IAF_F-16D_B40_Israel" alt="IAF_F-16D_B40_Israel" /></a></p>
<p>Israel’s current military expenditures, the highest per capita in the world, are approximately $14 billion a year and roughly <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html">7.3% of its GDP</a>. Israel has over <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/6/Facets%20of%20the%20Israeli%20Economy-%20The%20Defense%20Industr">150 defense industries,</a> with revenues of $3.5 billion. Yet Americans are paying for between one-third and one-half of Israel’s military budget, or subsidizing Israel’s GDP by 2.5% or more. The only way to reverse Israel’s extreme right turn is to place these military burdens on their own shoulders. This can be a painful reminder to Israeli voters of how expensive their misadventures in the Occupied Territories have become (just like our own disaster in Iraq). In any case, Americans should not be responsible for bailing out Israel. In regard to diplomatic sanctions, however, it is not productive for <em>any</em> country (for example, Venezuela) to cut off relations with Israel. Peace only happens when enemies talk. And Israel has a <em>lot</em> of enemies. Besides, doesn’t it accomplish more to call in the Israeli ambassador weekly for a well-publicized dressing-down?</p>
