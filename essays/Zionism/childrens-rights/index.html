<p>Suddenly a few Republicans are demonstrating that they actually have souls. Franklin Graham, Laura Bush and even Melania Trump are among those who have recently spoken out against separating children from their parents at the border.</p>
<p>Another insidious form of child abuse has taken place for decades in Palestinian occupied territories, where Israel routinely rounds up and imprisons hundreds of children each year. I am forwarding an appeal from Jeff Klein, of Mass Peace Action, asking Congress to support the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4391">McCollum Bill</a>, which so far has only two Massachusetts Congressional sponsors. I have written about Betty McCollum’s legislation before. Please read Jeff’s letter and then contact Congressional Reps. Richard <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/richard_neal/400291">Neal</a>, Niki <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/niki_tsongas/412254">Tsongas</a>, Joseph <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joseph_kennedy/412543">Kennedy</a> III, Katherine <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/katherine_clark/412600">Clark</a>, Michael <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/michael_capuano/400063">Capuano</a>, Stephen <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/stephen_lynch/400249">Lynch</a>, and Bill <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/william_keating/412435">Keating</a>, to let them know they need to be on the right side of this issue. They need to be better friends to children than to a government that just last month slaughtered hundreds of demonstrators.</p>

<p><strong>STAND UP AGAINST THE ABUSE OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>Dear Activist,</p>
<p>When many Americans and their elected officials are protesting the mistreatment of immigrant minors at our southern border, it is time to renew our demand that Members of Congress also speak up to protect Palestinian children.</p>
<p>When we sent out our earlier alert on the <strong>McCollum Bill</strong>, <a target="_blank" href="https://mccollum.house.gov/palestinianchildrensrights">Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4391/cosponsors">H.R. 4391</a>, only one member of the Massachusetts delegation, Rep. Jim McGovern CD2), had co-sponsored the resolution. Since then, CD6 Rep Seth Moulton has joined him in supporting the bill. But other members of our delegation have not yet taken a stand against the abuse of Palestinian children. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>There are two things you can do.</strong></p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><strong>CALL YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS</strong> to ask that they co-sponsor the McCollum Bill. Do it again even if you have called before. (And please thank Reps. McGovern and Moulton for their co-sponsorship.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is Rep. McCollum’s explanation of the bill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Given that the Israeli government receives billions of dollars in assistance from the United States, Congress must work to ensure that American taxpayer dollars never support the Israeli military’s detention or abuse of Palestinian children. Congresswoman McCollum’s legislation, the Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act, requires that the Secretary of State certify that American funds do not support Israel’s military detention, interrogation, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>ASK THAT THEIR OFFICES ATTEND A BRIEFING JUNE 25</strong> on H.R. 4391 and the situation for Palestinian children after the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem. You can use the No Way To Treat a Child campaign tool to <a target="_blank" href="https://nwttac.dci-palestine.org/hr_4391_and_the_situation_for_palestinian_children_after_us_embassy_move">send an email</a> asking Members of Congress to send a representative to the briefing<strong>.</strong> If you are in contact with a relevant Congressional staffer, also please phone them directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each year the Israeli military arrests and prosecutes around <a target="_blank" href="https://nwttac.dci-palestine.org/">700 Palestinian children</a>. Last year alone, more than <a target="_blank" href="https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/maureen-clare-murphy/these-are-palestinian-children-israel-killed-2017">fourteen Palestinian boys and girls</a> under the age of 18 were shot dead by Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip — and many more were wounded – using resources provided by our own government. We cannot allow this situation to continue.</p>
<p>For Massachusetts Peace Action and its <strong>New Day for Israel and Palestine</strong> organizing project.</p>
<p><em>Jeff Klein, Convener, MAPA Palestine/Israel Working Group</em></p>
