According to a 2012 [ Congressional Research Service ](http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33222_20120312.pdf) report, Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. To date, the United States has provided Israel $115 billion in military assistance. Strong congressional support for Israel has resulted in Israel receiving benefits not available to any other countries; for example, Israel can use some U.S. military assistance both for research and development in the United States and for military purchases from Israeli manufacturers. In addition, all U.S. assistance earmarked for Israel is delivered in the first 30 days of the fiscal year, while most other recipients normally receive aid in installments. In addition to receiving U.S. State Department-administered foreign assistance, Israel also receives funds from annual defense appropriations bills for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense programs.

The Obama Administration's FY2013 request includes $3.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel and $15 million for refugee resettlement. Within the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S. Missile Defense Agency's FY2013 budget request includes $99.8 million in joint U.S.-Israeli co-development for missile defense.

On March 5, 2012, House lawmakers introduced H.R. 4133, the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012. If passed, this bill would, among other things, allocate additional weaponry and munitions for the forward-deployed United States stockpile in Israel; provide Israel additional surplus defense articles and defense services, as appropriate, in the wake of the withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq; expand Israel's authority to make purchases under the Foreign Military Financing program on a commercial basis; encourage an expanded role for Israel within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including an enhanced presence at NATO headquarters and exercises; support extension of the long-standing loan guarantee program for Israel, recognizing Israel's unbroken record of repaying its loans on time and in full; and require the President to submit a report on the status of Israel's qualitative military edge in light of current trends and instability in the region.

The Washington Post reported last year that Israel receives $9-10 billion a year in economic loans (ESF funds) guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

The U.S. War Reserves Stocks for Allies program from the 1980's allows the US to store weaponry in Israel, and to "lend" it to Israel. Some of this weaponry was used in Gaza in 2008. Basically, this is a military welfare program.

A 1984 Christian Science Monitor article reported that in that year Congress passed a law sponsored by Alan Cranston and &#8211;_ note the name_ &#8212; Joe Biden which essentially forgave Israel a $9 billion debt by giving it the funds to cancel the outstanding debt.

And periodically ESF and military debts to Israel are simply forgiven or written off. This is money we cannot afford, but Israel receives more bipartisan largesse than the American working poor. The Congressional Research Service estimates we have given $130 billion to Israel over the years.

Israel maintains military control over a vast disputed area in the West Bank. If we translate it into American terms, it is like the US occupying Mexico and Central America. This costs serious money.

But last October ( 2011), Israel actually cut its own defense spending by $850 million - 5%. How can it afford to do this ? Because we, the American taxpayers, are picking up the tab.
