The American Jewish Committee's David Harris claims [in an article in the Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405052179950442.html) that travel between Caracas and Teheran without visas represents a threat to the Western Hemisphere.

There are many countries which have reciprocal agreements that make visas unnecessary for unrestricted travel. Israel and the United States were once examples of this.

Until recently.

Israel now applies [racial and religious profiling](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1113841.html) to American tourists. The AJC hasn't uttered a word about this.

Harris is a good example of the aging "Israel first" mentality which, until the last few years, has had no serious competition in speaking for Jews in America. 

American Jews are overwhelmingly committed to democratic institutions, but organizations like AIPAC, ZOA and Harris' AJC can't seem to stay out of bed with neoconservatives, Christian fundamentalists, and right wing racists when Israel is involved. Or they simply ignore American interests altogether, as the issue of visas demonstrates. 

This has created an opening for dozens of Jewish peace groups, including the new lobbying organization JStreet, whose members prefer American democratic values where Israel and American foreign policy are concerned.

"Israel first" groups like the AJC would do well to ponder for a moment why it is that they put the word "American" in their names. They are increasingly mere mouthpieces for Israeli _hasbara_ campaigns and have ceased to represent either American or Jewish values.
