<p>It finally found its way into my synagogue’s newsletter.</p>
<p>Making its rounds on the internet is a sermon entitled “Ehr kumt”
(Yiddish for “he’s coming”) given during last year’s Jewish High
Holidays by Rabbi Shlomo J. Lewis of Atlanta’s Etz Chaim (Conservative)
synagogue. The piece, also called by its admirers the “Sermon of the
Century,” has been reproduced on all the usual Islamophobia hate sites,
the Republican Jewish Committee’s web site, and its notoriety has
increased due to commendations for Lewis by the <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2001_02/sum/hr76.htm">Georgia
legislature</a> and the US <a
target="_blank" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2003_record&amp;page=E969&amp;position=all">House
of Representatives</a>. I won’t reproduce the almost 4000-word piece
because it’s simply too long, but if you haven’t read it you will find
it <a
target="_blank" href="http://jewishjournal.org/story/news_features/ehr_kumt/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Quite simply, it’s nothing but a piece of hate speech by a religious
leader. Not only that, it’s a piece of <em>dreck</em> delivered at a
pulpit by a rabbi on the first day of Rosh Hashanah – a day for
introspection and self-examination, not high political theater.</p>
<p>I read and found the sermon very offensive, as I do any time a
preacher, rabbi or imam takes to the pulpit to bludgeon his congregation
with bigotry. It reminded me of an exchange with a Muslim neighbor who
emailed me that “I want to tell you that the situation in the U.S. now
is similar to that in Germany in 1935, where bigotry, hatred, lies, and
wide-spread discrimination against a hunted minority were very common.”
His deepest fears, true or only partially true, made me wonder what sort
of ranting about Jews was common in German churches in 1935.</p>
<p>I thought about this while I re-read Rabbi Lewis’ sermon and it
struck me as ironic that a Jew – a rabbi no less – would willingly play
the part of religious <em>Hetzer.</em></p>
<p><img src="priests.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the Germany of 1935, while there were certainly members of the
clergy like Dietrich <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.bonhoeffer.com/bak1.htm">Bonhoeffer</a>, Martin
Niemoeller, or Karl Barth, who spoke out clearly and with almost as much
passion as Jewish prophets themselves against the Nazi regime, for the
most part the <em>Pfarrer</em> (pastors) of <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206">mainly</a>
the <em>Evangelische</em> (Lutheran) church (but also the Catholic
church) practically tripped over themselves in embracing the new German
culture war on Jews. Even the <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5174463,00.html">church
itself</a> was enlisted in the persecution. <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/a-conversation-with-susannah-heschel-1.271999">Susannah
Heschel</a> has documented this sad chapter of German religious
history.</p>
<p>Rabbi Lewis reminds me of a pastor in some Pomeranian backwater who
chose to deliver – not a homily on redemption and hope – but the most
virulent, anti-Semitic diatribe he could think of on an Easter morning
in 1935, using some of Lewis’ own themes and words to paint a portrait
of Jewish evil. The pastor might have invoked passages from Martin
Luther’s 1543 pamphlet, “Von den Jüden und ihren Lügen” (<a
target="_blank" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Luther_on_Jews.html">About
the Jews and their Lies</a>), as Lewis seems to take his from the world
of Islamophobia.</p>
<p>On this holiest of days Lewis led with a martial theme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are at war. We are at war with an enemy as savage, as voracious,
as heartless as the Nazi.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ridiculing what he regards as present-day “moral relativism” and
political correctness, Lewis’ prescription is to return to the imagined
moral absolutes of an idealized World War II:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Evil – ultimate, irreconcilable, evil threatened us and Roosevelt
and Churchill had moral clarity and an exquisite understanding of what
was at stake. It was not just the Sudetenland, not just Tubruk, not just
Vienna, not just Casablanca. <em>It was the entire planet</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evil that faces us, then, according to Lewis, is <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/War_and_Peace/Combat_and_Conflict/Types_of_War/Genocide.shtml">Amalek</a>
– the personification of evil and existential threat. Lewis then
continues the story for which his sermon is named. It is the story of
none other than the neo-fascist <a
target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism">Revisionist
Zionist</a> Ze’ev <a
target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Jabotinsky">Jabotinsky</a>
showing up at a synagogue in Kovno, Lithuania, and warning the city’s
Jews of impending doom. Lewis embellishes the story to paint Jabotinsky
as a prophet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When Jabotinsky came, he delivered the <em>drash</em> [sermon] on
Shabbos morning and I can still hear his words burning in my ears. He
climbed up to the <em>shtender</em>, [lectern] stared at us from the
<em>bima </em>[pulpit], glared at us with eyes full of fire and cried
out. ‘EHR KUMT. YIDN FARLAWST AYER SHTETL – He’s coming. Jews abandon
your city.’ We thought we were safe in Lithuania from the Nazis, from
Hitler. We had lived there, thrived for a thousand years but Jabotinsky
was right – his warning <em>prophetic</em>. We got out but most did not.
[…] We are not in Lithuania. It is not the 1930s. There is no Luftwaffe
overhead. No U-boats off the coast of long Island. No Panzer divisions
on our borders. But make no mistake; we are under attack – <em>our
values, our tolerance, our freedom, our virtue, our land.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These last words are exactly the same ones our German pastor would
have used in 1935: <em>Unsere Freiheit, unsere Ehre, unsere Heimat.</em>
Lewis doesn’t even have any idea of how distastefully he has
expropriated the same language used against Jews by Nazi
collaborators.</p>
<p>At this point, the congregation is transfixed. Lewis is working the
pulpit, reciting Prophet Jabotinsky’s words. But this time the villains
are not Nazis or the mutable forms of Amalek – but Muslims. High
Holidays be damned, Lewis is not in a forgiving mood. Muslims – all
Muslims – are <em>guilty by association</em>. If they aren’t
perpetrators, they’re mute enablers of evil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today the enemy is radical Islam but it must be said sadly and
reluctantly that there are unwitting, co-conspirators who strengthen the
hands of the evil doers. Let me state that the overwhelming number of
Muslims are good Muslims, fine human beings who want nothing more than a
Jeep Cherokee in their driveway, a flat screen TV on their wall and a
good education for their children, but these <em>good Muslims have an
obligation to destiny</em>, to decency that thus far for the most part
they have avoided. The <em>Kulturkampf</em> is not only external but
internal as well. The <em>good Muslims</em> must sponsor rallies in
Times Square, in Trafalgar Square, in the UN Plaza, on the Champs
Elysee, in Mecca condemning terrorism, denouncing unequivocally the
slaughter of the innocent. Thus far, they have not. The good Muslims
must place ads in the NY Times. They must buy time on network TV, on
cable stations, in the Jerusalem Post, in Le Monde, in Al Watan, on Al
Jazeera condemning terrorism, denouncing unequivocally the slaughter of
the innocent – thus far, they have not. Their silence allows the vicious
to tarnish Islam and define it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the same could be said about his own congregation’s – most
any Jewish congregation’s – silence on Israel’s treatment of
Palestinians, but Lewis’ point is clear: there really are no good
Muslims because even the “good” ones have thumbed their noses at their
obligation to destiny and decency. And worse: they haven’t chosen sides
properly in the <em>Kulturkampf</em>. For the remainder of his talk,
Lewis doesn’t bother making a distinction between terrorists, Islamic
radicals, Islamists, political Islamists, or just plain Muslims. His
audience knows what he means.</p>
<p>But what Lewis is peddling is stronger than just
<em>Kulturkampf</em>. It’s <em>War of the Worlds</em> or maybe an
old-fashioned Evangelical Apocalypse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let us understand that the radical Islamist assaults all over the
globe are but skirmishes, fire fights, and vicious decoys. Christ and
the anti-Christ. Gog U’Magog. The Sons of Light and the Sons of
Darkness; the bloody collision between <em>civilization and
depravity</em> is on the border between Lebanon and Israel. It is on the
Gaza Coast and in the Judean Hills of the West Bank. It is on the sandy
beaches of Tel Aviv and on the cobblestoned mall of Ben Yehuda Street.
It is in the underground schools of Sderot and on the bullet-proofed
inner-city buses. It is in every school yard, hospital, nursery,
classroom, park, theater – in every place of innocence and purity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in many <em>shuls</em>, Lewis is playing to a crowd that sees
Israel as a beleaguered <em>Western</em> force of good fighting forces
of darkness and evil (translation: <em>Muslims</em>). The rest of Lewis’
rant is reserved for whining about Europeans, NGOs, the United Nations,
the “liberal” media, and Christian Liberation Theology. For Lewis it’s
not just about terrorism. It’s about the Muslim hordes knocking on the
gates of Vienna while the liberal appeasers make tea for them.</p>
<p>Next, Lewis paints Islam as a disease to be eradicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let’s try an analogy. If someone contracted a life-threatening
infection and we not only scolded them for using antibiotics but
insisted that the bacteria had a right to infect their body and that
perhaps, if we gave the invading infection an arm and a few toes, the
bacteria would be satisfied and stop spreading. […] Anyone buy that
medical advice? Well, folks, that’s our approach to the radical
<em>Islamist bacteria</em>. It is <em>amoral, has no conscience</em> and
will spread unless it is eradicated. – There is no negotiating.
Appeasement is death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="bacteria.jpg" /></p>
<p>I found this disturbing and repugnant because, once again, my
neighbor had a point. In 1935 German propaganda posters portrayed Jews
as a bacteria. <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.yadvashem.org/download/education/conf/Millsishedwithoutpic.pdf">Yad
Vashem</a> has also documented a series of “educational” materials
published at the time in Germany which included descriptions of Jews
as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… foreigners threatening to displace the Germans from Germany. As
hyenas strike disabled animals, Jews are portrayed as preying upon
disadvantaged Germans/Christians. Other animals included in these
comparisons are the chameleon (the great deceiver), the locust (the
scourge of God) […] and the tapeworm (the parasite of humanity).
<em>Finally, Jews are compared to deadly bacteria, which threatens the
existence of the human race. Just as deadly bacteria must be
exterminated, so must the Jew.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now concentration camps and crematoria hopefully weren’t in the back
of the good rabbi’s mind when he talked of “eradicating” the Islamist
bacteria. But what in God’s name <em>was</em> he thinking? I suspect,
for Lewis and his right wing political message, God didn’t even enter
the equation. This was not a <em>drash</em>. It was a political rant, an
abuse of his position.</p>
<p>Lewis then moves on to a meditation on the story of an Afghan woman
who was a victim of an “honor” disfigurement by a relative– something
which unfortunately occurs numerous developing, not just Muslim,
countries. For Lewis, though, it’s all about Islam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If nothing else stirs us. If nothing else convinces us, let Bibi
Aisha’s mutilated face be the face of Islamic radicalism. Let her face
shake up even the most complacent and naive among us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewis then finishes with a rhetorical flourish, once again using the
neo-fascist Jabotinsky’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A rabbi was once asked by his students….’Rebbi. Why are your sermons
so stern?’ Replied the rabbi, ‘If a house is on fire and we chose not to
wake up our children, for fear of disturbing their sleep, would that be
love? <em>Kinderlach, di hoyz brent</em>.’ Children our house is on fire
and I must arouse you from your slumber. […] My friends – the world is
on fire and we must awake from our slumber. ‘HER KUMT.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the end of a pathetic performance that should never have
taken place at a synagogue, much less the pulpit, and never on the first
day of Rosh Hashanah. This was the kind of outrageous performance one
expects from Glen Beck or David Duke.</p>
<p>On the same day, my rabbi, in contrast – also at a Conservative
synagogue – talked about new beginnings. He cited stories, without
embarrassing individuals, of people who had made enormous, positive
changes in their lives over the course of the year. It was as inspiring
and sweet as Lewis’ was repellant and hateful.</p>
<p>What now for rabbi Lewis, flush with his 15 minutes of fame? He’s
back at it again. His latest message to his congregation is again a <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.etzchaim.net/pdfs/rsl-ltrtocongregation-oct2010.pdf">long
political piece</a> you’ll just have to read to understand why the
framers of the U.S. Constitution wanted separation of church and state.
I sincerely hope Rabbi Lewis’ congregants don’t need him for spiritual
matters pertaining to Judaism or for pastoral counseling. Because this
is a guy truly obsessed with seeing evil in Muslims and too busy writing
his political screeds.</p>
