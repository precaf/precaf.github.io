<p>I am an unapologetic anti-Zionist. I do not accept that a “chosen”
people ought to have exclusive ownership over any chunk of the planet.
No self-respecting omnipotent creature — if such even existed — would
sign over real estate of a paltry seven or eight thousand square miles
of land to a tiny number of people on a puny planet in a vast cosmos of
trillions of possible worlds. Where’s the ambition in that?</p>
<p>Moreover, I do not accept that <em>any</em> privileged group has the
right to lay claim to any part of the planet or its resources. Each of
the many worlds in the universe belongs to all of the living creatures
in it. This essential belief probably explains why I’m a socialist on
top of my many other faults.</p>
<p>Last week, on one of my walks, I listened to a couple of episodes
with Shaul Magid on Daniel Denvir’s podcast, “The Dig.” Magid has
exceptional recall, insight and clarity into the nature and history of
Zionism and the two episodes I listened to covered a lot of ground. They
are an excellent, quick introduction for anyone interested in what
Zionism is, and how it came about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magid - <a
target="_blank" href="https://thedigradio.com/podcast/zionism-vs-anti-zionism-ep-1-w-shaul-magid/">Zionism
(episode 1)</a></li>
<li>Magid - <a
target="_blank" href="https://thedigradio.com/podcast/zionism-vs-anti-zionism-ep-2-w-shaul-magid/">Zionism
(episode 2)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides being an historian, Magid is also a rabbi. Having listened to
his dissections of Zionism in “The Dig”, for all those criticisms I
don’t think I ever heard him actually <em>repudiate</em> Zionism. It may
be relevant that he’s also a citizen of the state of Israel. And yet —
Magid’s a sort of <em>un-Zionist</em> Zionist. One of a growing
percentage of American Jews.</p>
<p>In one of the podcast episodes, Magid remarks how similar his thought
is to Hannah Arendt’s and that he almost always has one of her books on
his desk. Like Arendt, Magid wrestles with the many contradictions and
malignancy of Zionism’s illiberal, racist supremacism and its inherent
incompatibility with democracy. But what really bothers him is how
<em>limited</em> Zionism is, and how much damage it has done to
Judaism.</p>
<p>So it was perfect timing that a new book of Magid’s just appeared.
Emily Tamkin’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://forward.com/opinion/574657/shaul-magid-counter-zionist-israel/">review</a>
of Magid’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176028633-the-necessity-of-exile">The
Necessity of Exile</a> in the <em>Forward</em>, a Zionist Jewish
cultural magazine, describes it as a book to challenge Jews to imagine
something new and different. Tamkin diplomatically describes Magid not
as an anti-Zionist but as a “counter-Zionist” — which will nevertheless
provoke strong antipathies from some of her readers.</p>
<p>In his podcasts, Magid makes the point that Zionism has to a great
degree replaced or become a dangerous central tenet of Judaism. Early
Zionists had little or no interest in religion, today many Israelis are
secular, and if Jews in North America and elsewhere do not support
Zionism they are not even acknowledged as being Jewish.</p>
<p>Magid cites the November 3rd essay in the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-771479">Jerusalem Post</a>
(“No longer part of us”) in which anti-Zionist Jews are characterized as
Hamas sympathizers or more “charitably” as the “wicked child” in the
Passover Haggadah — as outsiders, as non-Jews. <em>Break the Sabbath all
you want, eat pork and shellfish, and marry outside the faith. But don’t
question Zionism!</em></p>
<p>Judaism may be an ancient religion, but rabbinic Judaism,
particularly the elaboration of religious, ethical and moral positions
developed in the Talmud over centuries, is of more recent vintage and is
the legacy of disaporic Jews. On the secular side, innumerable elements
of Jewish culture, from Yiddish and Ladino, literature, theatre, Klezmer
music, food, humor, and general <em>Yiddishkayt</em>, are likewise
cultural products of the diaspora.</p>
<p>With all this richness, and with the manifest poverty of Zionism,
Magid’s book seems to promise an exploration of how Jews can reclaim
both the religion and the culture from the death grip of an
ethno-nationalism that violates so many of Judaism’s ethical
prohibitions.</p>
<p>While there have always been tensions between Judaism’s liberal and
conservative sensibilities, the religion of Rabbinic Judaism and the
culture that developed around it have at least preserved liberal
elements not found in the Revisionist Zionism of Benjamin Netanyahu’s
Likud, the religious Zionism of Bezalel Smotrich’s National Religious
Party, or the Jewish supremacist Zionism of Itamar Ben Gvir’s Jewish
Power Party. For those who wax nostalgic for the defunct Labor or Meretz
parties, their “kinder, gentler” version of Zionism was equally
dedicated to ethnic cleansing and occupation as any of the recent
extremist parties.</p>
<p>I reject the common view of older American Jews that Israel is an
insurance policy, “the only safe place on earth for Jews.” If the last
75 years — and especially the last 75 days — have shown us anything,
it’s how delusional this view is. Israel is neither a safe haven nor a
light unto the nations. It is a profoundly screwed-up, repressive state
run by extremists, coddled and preserved only at enormous cost by
non-Jewish colonial world powers who need it for their own geopolitical
purposes.</p>
<p>It enrages Zionists that young Jews are calling for freedom in
Palestine “from the river to the sea.” The moral rot of Zionism can only
envision ethno-nationalist supremacy within this geography. Any other
vision invokes an irrational, illogical, and propagandistic reflex that
claims these young Jews want a second Holocaust to extinguish the lives
of their Israeli cousins.</p>
<p>Such claims invariably regurgitate talking points from the many
Zionist organizations that exist solely to run defense for Israel’s
indefensible foreign and domestic policies. But they also represent the
failure to envision anything beyond the <em>de facto</em> Apartheid
state that now exists from the river to the sea.</p>
<p>Magid’s book’s in the mail. I’m looking forward to reading what he’s
got to say.</p>
