<p><img src="settlement.jpg" /> Nof Zion is a religious Zionist
settlement in East Jerusalem created by removing the Palestinian
residents of Jabel Mukaber (Author, 2009)</p>
<p>Friends and family know that I am no partisan of Israel’s ethnic
cleansing of Palestine, its 75-year occupation of Palestinians now
either relegated to refugee camps or internally-displaced, controlled by
barbed wire, high-tech fences, whose movements are controlled by
ubiquitous checkpoints, who are surveilled, suffer warrantless searches
by the Israeli military and indeterminate detention without recourse to
a justice system only for Jews, whose houses are bulldozed or
expropriated by settlers, who are denied their own state, ringed by
settlements that further ghettoize them and breed resentment and hatred,
such as we saw last week.</p>
<p><img src="checkpoint.jpg" /> for Palestinians in the West Bank there
is no such thing as freedom of movement. Instead, checkpoints and walls
and barbed wire (Author, 2009)</p>
<p>I have friends and family with Israeli roots, and I am still in touch
with peace activists from the Eshkol district in Israel where almost all
the attacks occurred. I have plenty of anger and grief over what
happened in the Negev. But I do think we have to be honest about where
Palestinian resentment comes from. We also need to admit that killing a
child, whether by commando, blockade, sanctions on medical equipment, or
F16, is <em>still</em> the murder of a child.</p>
<p>Over the years I have followed Israel’s many military operations
against both Fatah and Hamas; its shameful participation in the 1982
Sabra and Shatila massacres of 3,500 Palestinians in Lebanon by
Falangist militias; a commando attack on the Mavi Marmara, which killed
19 peace activists, including Americans trying to deliver aid to Gaza;
Israel’s disproportionate use of military force in Operation Cast Lead,
the 2008 version of what is likely to come this week; and the killing of
journalists, last year Palestinian-American reporter Shireen Abu Akleh,
three days ago Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah.</p>
<p>I have met Palestinians whose olive groves are routinely vandalized
or destroyed by settlers, whose young men are routinely harassed in
often deadly versions of Stop and Frisk, and whose children are detained
without warrant or counsel in adult prisons for throwing rocks. I have
met Gazans who live in the tiny enclave of refugee camps the size of
Detroit – but with 3.5 times the population – and can’t even fish the
waters off their own coast. And I have met Palestinians who still have
the key to a home now occupied by a Jewish family in Jerusalem. Both
historical and daily wounds afflict Palestinians because of ethnic
cleansing and occupation that began in the 20th Century and festers well
into the 21st.</p>
<p>Over time Israel’s politics have lurched from right to far right. Its
37th government is now comprised of extremists who intend to neuter
Israel’s supreme court – the last obstacle to full annexation of the
West Bank. And they also want to impose religious restrictions, such as
gender segregation and changes to marriage law, on even secular
citizens. Last week’s trauma to Israel has been compared to 9/11. As
with 9/11, when Americans began chanting “USA! USA!,” Israelis now heed
the call to “Stand with Israel.” Trauma seems to feed nationalism. This
is also true of Palestinians.</p>
<p>A member of the ruling coalition recently endorsed pogroms on
Palestinian villages after extremist settlers went on a rampage of
killing and arson. “I think the village of Huwara needs to be wiped out.
I think the state of Israel should do it,” said Israeli Minister of
Finance Bezalel Smotrich, who is also responsible for civil
administration in the occupied West Bank. Meanwhile, Israel’s Security
Minister Itamar Ben Gvir enlightened journalists with his Jewish
supremacist views: “My right, the right of my wife and my children to
move around Judea and Samaria [biblical names for the West Bank] is more
important than freedom of movement for the Arabs.”</p>
<p>These are the gloves-off versions of Apartheid and ethnic cleansing
that Israel’s government was once too ashamed to say out loud. Before
Hamas attacked Israel such talk was beginning to frighten semi-liberal
secular Israelis. Now Israel’s pro-democracy demonstrators are fully
behind a new war government that has already killed over 2,000 in Gaza
with indiscriminate bombing.</p>
<p>But territorial maximalism is a primary goal of all the political
parties in Israel’s coalition government. Israel’s settler movement and
its friends in the Knesset are still angry about Arial Sharon’s 2005
withdrawal from Gaza. Even if Hamas had not attacked Israel last week,
many expected extremist ministers to propose re-establishing some of the
21 Jewish settlements that once occupied 45% of the Gaza Strip. Such
talk has surfaced in the wake of the attacks, and Israel is now forcing
1.1 <em>million</em> Gazans to flee south – an incomprehensible number
which Palestinians fear could create a second <em>Nakba</em>
(catastrophe). Those with passports are fleeing across the Erez Crossing
into Egypt. Between the bombing and the forced expulsions, there will
surely be another reduction in the population of Gaza. Someone has
called it “ethnic cleansing on the installment plan.”</p>
<p>Throughout the years the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem has
documented the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians through
raids, military operations, or settler violence. Israel calls this
periodic bloodletting “mowing the grass.” In its efforts to target Hamas
fighters, Israel manages to mow down mostly civilians, more often than
not children. Each time a payment on the aforementioned installment
plan.</p>
<p>Even assuming that reports of children being decapitated by Hamas
fighters last week are true, why have so few tears been shed for the
thousands of children whose bodies are blown apart by Israeli bombs paid
for by American tax dollars? Perhaps for the same ugly reason it has
been so easy for Americans to kill Mexicans, Koreans, Vietnamese,
Central Americans, Puerto Ricans, Afghanis, and Iraqis. Israel certainly
has some soul-searching to do. Americans too.</p>
<p>For all the US State Department and Israeli Foreign Ministry press
releases expressing shock, anger, and solidarity — for all the many
emotional appeals, for all the bias in the media, the cynical
invocations of the Holocaust, the unfortunately necessary pushback
against antisemitic incidents that inevitably occur in the wake of this
conflict, or the religious and racial connections between Western Jews
and Christians – we’re still ignoring the most glaring feature of this
conflict: the wrongs done and wrongs being done to Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Occupation is Israel’s and Israel’s alone. Every death that
emanates from this conflict weighs most heavily on Israel because Israel
chooses not end the Occupation. No nation should enable, justify,
defend, or fund the Occupation. Let Israel go it alone and see how
quickly change can come about – when the US isn’t subsidizing it.</p>
<p>It is an abomination that Israel’s occupation has gone on for 75
years. The human misery it has inflicted and inflicts daily ought to
shame every Western power complicit in its continuation.</p>
<p>The United States must not provide a cent more to Israel.</p>
