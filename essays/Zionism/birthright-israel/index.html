<p>The bright blue background of the website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.birthrightisrael.com">http://www.birthrightisrael.com</a> depicts smiling Jewish kids popping up in goofy Flash animations, along with the words “Your adventure. Your birthright. Our gift.” For many, Taglit-Birthright Israel equals a free vacation. Trips to the Masada, target practice with the IDF, working on a kibbutz, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.birthrightisrael.com/site/PageServer?pagename=trip_howchooseto">three and four star hotels</a>, a little eco-tourism, late night DJ parties and “mega events”, and maybe some sex on the beach.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="18_img_0060.jpg"><img src="18_img_0060.jpg" title="Ready, aim, fire!" alt="Ready, aim, fire!" /></a></p>
<p>The “Birthright” experience <a target="_blank" href="http://www.birthrightisrael.com/site/PageServer?pagename=trip_safetyandsecurity">shields participants</a> from Arabs in the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, or Israel’s Arab largest communities. All itineraries are cleared by the government, and the authorities are aware of each group’s location at all times via GPS. Participants are unlikely to get a glimpse of what <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifpbdel.org/reports.html">life is like in the Occupied Territories</a> for Palestinians or within Israel proper for Arab Israelis like former Knesset member <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-bishara3may03,0,2351340.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Azmi Bishara</a>.</p>
<p>Taglit-Birthright Israel describes itself as a “unique, historical partnership between the people of Israel through their government, local Jewish communities (North American Jewish Federations through the United Jewish Communities; <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keren_Hayesod">Keren Hayesod</a>; and The Jewish Agency for Israel), and leading Jewish philanthropists”. Since its inception, over <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=254&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2831">200,000 young adults</a>, 75% from North America, have made the 10-day trips. The cost of the program to-date has been $450 million. Any American Jewish young adult from 18-26 who has never been to Israel before and who is part of a Jewish community with a Zionist organization (Federation or UJC) qualifies for this program – designed to encourage young adults to <em>make aliyah</em> (immigrate) to or to at least enhance <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=254&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2831">ahavat Yisrael</a></em> (love of Israel).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="29_hkbuyg_fs.jpg"><img src="29_hkbuyg_fs.jpg" title="Fire!" alt="Fire!" /></a></p>
<p>Under Israel’s original <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return">Law of Return</a>, any Jew (technically a person with a Jewish mother) could become an Israeli citizen. In 1970 the law was amended to permit non-Jews with a Jewish grandparent, in-laws, parent or spouse to immigrate as well. The <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3152651.stm">Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law of 2003</a> restricts immigration of Arabs of childbearing age who are residents of the West Bank and Gaza. But American Jewish and even non-Jewish Russians of childbearing age are most welcome to come to Israel and alter the demographics. Interestingly, Israeli law and Zionist programs like Birthright seem to be designed to slow Arab population growth more than to preserve Judaism. Israel now has more than 300,000 non-Jewish Russians alone. In 1999, half of all <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/11965/immigration-of-non-jews-to-israel-increasing/">Russian immigrants</a> were not Jewish.</p>
<p>But if you really want to clinch the deal, bringing kids to Zionist Disneyland isn’t quite enough. You’ve got to show them the crematoria. Taglit-Birthright Israel has combined a program with the International March of the Living tour of Polish death camps.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="44_610x.jpg"><img src="44_610x.jpg" title="44_610x" alt="44_610x" /></a></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://motl.org/programs/youngLeaderBirthright.htm">website</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A special emphasis is placed on the topic of the Holocaust and Jewish life in Central Europe prior to WWII. Included are visits to concentration camps and centers of Jewish life and culture in Poland prior to the program in Israel. Also explored is the absorption of WWII survivors into Israeli life after the War. […] The tours and activities incorporate all of these subjects into experiences with the sights, sounds, smells and sense of touch in contemporary Israel.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And apparently it works. There are countless stories, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.giltroy.com/zionismandisrael/BirthrightIsraelwhyIwaswrong.htm">like this one</a>, from disaffected Jewish teens who have overnight become card-carrying Zionists. Others, like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mindspring.com/~dbholzel/1025.html">this one</a>, reflect on the emotional manipulation of these tours.</p>
<h3 id="an-alternative">An Alternative</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.birthrightunplugged.org/">Birthright Unplugged</a> is not funded by Jewish federations or Zionist philanthropy, but offers Jewish teens a tour which provides a more accurate view of the reality for Palestinians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In six days, we visit Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank and spend time with internally displaced Palestinian people living inside Israel. Throughout the journey, we help participants develop an understanding of daily life under occupation and the history of the region from people profoundly affected by and under-represented in Western discourses about the occupation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also runs trips for Palestinian teens which often gives them a first glimpse of East Jerusalem or the sea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.birthrightunplugged.org/replugged">Re-Plugged trips</a></strong> are for Palestinian children living in refugee camps. In two to three days, we visit Jerusalem, the sea and the villages their grandparents fled in 1948. The children stay with families who are Palestinian citizens of Israel. They document their experiences with cameras and create exhibits in order to contribute to the collective memory in the refugee camp and to share their stories with people abroad. […] This experience is nearly impossible for most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, who receive identity cards at age 16 which Israel uses to control their movement. As internationals we are able to move with relative freedom and so, unlike the children’s parents and grandparents, we can take them on this trip.</p>
