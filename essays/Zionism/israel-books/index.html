<h4 id="suggested-reading"><strong>Suggested Reading</strong></h4>
<p>I’m sure there are plenty of great books on the subject. I can only
recommend ones I’ve actually read:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164744.1949">1949: The
First Israelis</a> by Tom Segev A co-editor of the Israeli newsweekly
<em>Koteret Rashit</em> and a former writer for the Tel Aviv newspaper
<em>Ha’aretz</em>, Segev was given access to previously restricted
official documents and personal diaries. The book tells the unvarnished
story of the first year’s effort to build the State of Israel and in
1986 raised an uproar in Israel when many of the country’s founding
myths were shown to be untrue. “1949” documents directives, many from
David Ben-Gurion, to expel and prohibit readmission of Palestinians.
Negev was perhaps the first Israeli to <em>document</em> the ethnic
cleansing of Palestinians. The second part of the book documents
Israel’s cruel treatment of Mizrahim (Arab Jews) and the growing
conflict between religious and secular Jews.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102195.A_History_of_Israel">A
History of Israel from the Rise of Zionism to Our Time</a> by Howard M.
Sachar This is a monster of a book. While Laqueur’s book (below) is on
placing Zionism in historical context, this book places Israel in
historical and world context. Just as one example, it describes the
British Mandate which was the agar plate on which Israeli statehood
grew. If you are interested in long descriptions of battles in Israel’s
various wars, with accompanying maps, this is for you (I skipped past a
lot of it). Though Sachar is no friend of the “new historians” and much
of his material seems to reflect “official” positions of the government,
other parts of the book seem fair. In a later chapter on Israeli
politics, for example, he cites a 1984 Knesset report on Orthodox
schools warning that “our schools have been thrown wide open to
chauvinist and antidemocratic influences.” Considerable anti-Arab hate
was generated by Rabbi Zvi Kook, spiritual leader of the <em>Gush
Emunim</em> settler movement. Religious arguments were twisted into hate
speech. Arabs became <em>Amalek</em>. “Death to the Arabs” became a
common phrase. The Techiya Party was founded by <em>Gush Emunim</em>
zealots who began calling for the expulsion of all Arabs. Other “hate”
parties popped up (Tsomet, Molodet, and Kach, established by Meier
Kahane). Kahane was a Brooklyn racist who founded the Jewish Defense
League and then emigrated to Israel. As Sachar describes him, Kahane was
a civic cancer much like Donald Trump: “Attracting public attention with
his demagoguery, [and] his flagrant appeals to racism and mob
intimidation […]” Israel’s Jewish nationalist bigotry is the twin of
America’s Christian nationalist bigotry and Kahanists now dominate
Israel’s current government.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173399.A_History_of_Zionism">A
History of Zionism</a> by Walter Zeev Laqueur This is an excellent
companion to Hertzberg’s anthology (below). While Hertzberg lets
Zionists speak for themselves, Laqueur places each in historical
context. He begins with the Jewish ghettos of the Middle Ages and ends
with the establishment of the state of Israel and, finally, <em>Thirteen
Theses on Zionism</em>. It is not unfair to say that Laqueur is a
conflicted admirer of Zionism. For him the jury’s still out, but as far
as he’s concerned it was a necessity. His theses are worth reading, and
their implications tell us certain things about Zionism. Thesis 3, for
example, points out that assimilation is the enemy of Zionism and a
product of contact with Europe. Thesis 8: The Zionist movement was
unclear about its objectives until Nazism arrived. The betrayal of
Palestinians by the West created much of the animosity toward Jewish
settlement. Thesis 9: This animosity sharpened as Zionism moved from a
cultural renewal focus to statehood. Thesis 10: “Seen from the Arab
point of view, Zionism was an aggressive movement, Jewish immigration an
invasion […] Throughout history nation-states have not come into
existence as the result of peaceful development and legal contracts.
They developed from invasions, colonisation, violence, and armed
struggle.” Laqueur adds, “It was the historical tragedy of Zionism that
it appeared on the international scene when there were no longer empty
spaces on the world map.” Thesis 13: Zionism has succeeded in restoring
dignity to Jews in the eyes of the world and becoming a focus for world
Jewry. But in terms of “fanciful” expectations (“Zion as a new spiritual
lodestar, a model for the redemption of mankind, a centre of humanity”)
it has not panned out quite as the early Zionists had hoped.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/478325.How_Israel_Lost">How
Israel Lost</a> by Richard Ben Cramer Cramer writes, “any Jew who isn’t
an Israeli and not on psychotropic drugs, could solve this
Peace-for-Israel thing in about ten minutes of focused thought. Give
back the land to the Palestinians. All of it [the West Bank, the Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem]. And since Palestinians are already living in
their own country, they should have equal rights, a fact so laughably
obvious – the only nation that can’t see this is Israel.” And this,
remarkably, is from a guy who doesn’t bother to disguise his contempt
for Arabs in general.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57540.The_Ethnic_Cleansing_of_Palestine">The
Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine</a> by Ilan Pappé Pappé is one of Israel’s
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians">New
Historians</a> who, with the release of British and Israeli government
documents in the early 1980s, began rewriting the history of Israel’s
creation in 1948, and the corresponding expulsion of 700,000
Palestinians that same year. Pappé maintained that the expulsions were
not on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis but constituted the intentional ethnic
cleansing of Palestinians in accordance with <em>Plan Dalet</em>, drawn
up in 1947 by Israel’s future leaders. By the time he left Israel in
2008, Pappé had been condemned in the Knesset, a minister of education
had called for him to be fired, his photograph with an attached bullseye
had appeared in a newspaper, and Pappé had received several death
threats. American historians grappling with our own white supremacy know
exactly what Pappé faced from those who refuse to look clear-eyed into
the mirror of history.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1257696.The_Iron_Cage">The
Iron Cage</a> by Rashid Khalidi This is an interesting book by a
Palestinian who looks at not only Israel’s (and the West’s) tight
control of Palestinians but at the historical errors pre-1948 which
Palestinian leaders made and which contributed to the non-existence of a
Palestinian state. Of course the West dealt the death-blow to
Palestinian statehood when Britain gave up Palestine. Foreign Secretary
Arthur James Balfour stated in 1919, “Zionism, be it right or wrong,
good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, in present needs, in
future hopes, of far greater import than the desires and prejudices of
the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land.” Translation:
<em>Fuck the Arabs</em>. Khalidi ends with an appeal to the U.S.,
Israeli, and Palestinian leadership to “look honestly at what has
happened in this small land over the past century […] and especially at
how repeatedly forcing the Palestinians into […] an iron cage, has
brought, and ultimately can bring, no lasting good to anyone.”</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/766486.The_Israel_Arab_Reader">The
Israel-Arab Reader</a> edited by Walter Laqueur and Barry Rubin Israel
is situated in a very big neighborhood and its nearest neighbors, the
Palestinians, often have no voice in historical accounts. This book does
not have a “through” narrative like many anthologies, but it is provides
a handy reference of important historical documents. It includes
hundreds of official documents and speeches, from some of the first
Zionist Congresses to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, to the San Remo
Conference assignment of Palestine to Britain, to the Balfour
Declaration, the PLO Constitution, speeches by Anwar Sadat, George
Schultz, Yasir Arafat, and more.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164780.The_Jewish_State">The
Jewish State</a> by Theodor Herzl In many ways this is the blueprint for
Israel. This book is also found in Arthur Hertzberg’s anthology as well
as on Project Gutenberg in both <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282">English</a> and in the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28865">original German</a>. It is
a fascinating read. Herzl did not have a democracy in mind for the
Jewish state (“I incline to an aristocratic republic”). Settlement was
to be coordinated by a colonial enterprise he called the “Jewish
Company” (not far off from the <a
target="_blank" href="https://archive.jewishagency.org/israel/content/23391/">Jewish
Agency</a> which actually accomplished the task ). The Constitution
(which never materialized) was to be forced upon the settlers (“Our
people, who are receiving the new country from the Society, will also
thankfully accept the new constitution it offers them. Should any
opposition manifest itself, the Society will suppress it”). This year
Herzl got his wish for an openly anti-democratic state. And as for those
living In Palestine already? Expropriate their property and kick them
out! “We must expropriate gently the private property on the state
assigned to us. We shall try to spirit the penniless population across
the border by procuring employment for it in the <em>transit
countries</em>, while denying it employment in <em>our country</em>. The
property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of
expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely
and circumspectly. Let the owners of the immoveable property believe
that they are cheating us, selling us things for more than they are
worth. But we are not going to sell them anything back.”</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/860703.The_Other_Israel">The
Other Israel: Voices of Refusal and Dissent</a> edited by Roane Carey
and Jonathan Shainin This is a collection of essays by writers,
journalists, academics, and historians on the Israeli Left. These
critics of Apartheid, Occupation, settlements, human rights abuses, and
Israeli domestic and foreign policy are as reviled as many of their
American equivalents on the progressive and socialist democratic Left.
In 2009 I was in Israel and met Jeff Halper, one of the contributors to
this volume, who discussed Israel’s “matrix of control” for the
systematic theft of Palestinian land. His essay on the topic is included
in this collection. The book concludes with Tom Segev’s essay on
“Transfer” – a common euphemism for ethnic cleansing used by many on the
Israeli right and center. And to be clear: ethnic cleansing is intended
not only for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Former Labor Party
minister Ephraim Sneh actually proposed transferring sovereignty of
Israeli Arab towns, including Umm al-Fahm which is near both Haifa and
Jenin, to the Palestinian Authority.</li>
<li><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/282238.The_Zionist_Idea">The
Zionist Idea</a> edited by Arthur Hertzberg Zionism may have originally
been intended to be Jewish self-determination in the service of
self-protection, pride, and autonomy, but it has become a lot like its
evil twin Christian nationalism. In this volume you hear the words of
Zionists themselves. And there are many. Those whose names you may
recognize include: Theodor Herzl (The Jewish State); Max Nordau; Hayyim
Nahman Bialik; Abraham Isaac Kook; Martin Buber; Mordecai Menahem Kaplan
– and some who actually had a hand in creating the state of Israel: Meir
Bar-Ilan; Vladimir Ze’ev Jabotinsky; Chaim Weizmann; Abba Hillel Silver;
and David Ben-Gurion.</li>

target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4190008-whither-israel">Whither
Israel? The Domestic Challenges</a> edited by Keith Kyle and Joel Peters
This book by British foreign policy specialists was first published in
1993 – thirty years ago – but still identifies many of the issues
catching up with Israel today. From the book’s blurb: “As it enters the
1990’s Israel faces crucial political, economic and social challenges.
Its parliamentary system is proving increasingly ineffective, prompting
demands for electoral and constitutional reform; its economy is beset by
stagnation, inflation and unemployment and its economic difficulties
feed and exacerbate existing social and political tensions. This book
considers the impact of these problems and their implication for the
future direction of Israeli politics and society. Different chapters
examine the social and ideological divisions that beset Israel, the
roots of the country’s economic problems, the dynamics of the Israeli
political system and recent developments within political parties.”</li>

<p>If you want to understand Israel you have to understand its
longest-serving Prime Minister and his attachment to Jabotinsky’s strain
of Zionism.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.jabotinsky.org/media/9747/the-iron-wall.pdf">The
Iron Wall</a> by Ze’ev Jabotinsky “Zionist colonisation must either
stop, or else proceed regardless of the native population. Which means
that it can proceed and develop only under the protection of a power
that is independent of the native population – behind an iron wall,
which the native population cannot breach.” Jabotinsky was an admirer of
Mussolini as were many of the Revisionist Zionists (until Italy’s
alliance with Germany). Benjamin Netanyahu is <a
