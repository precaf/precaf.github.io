<p>Shimon Peres, in his letter to the Diaspora, asks Jews to:</p>
<ul>
<li>seek peace, even as he insults Palestinians</li>
<li>fight for Israeli nuclear hegemony</li>
<li>oppose BDS by investing in Israel</li>
<li>keep indoctrinating your children</li>
<li>stand united with Israel, quoting scripture for political ends</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all increasingly a tough sell from a state that consistently betrays Jewish values while appealing to them: &gt; <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2009/Rosh_Hashanah_message_President_Peres_5770.htm">Message from the President of the State of Israel</a>, HE Shimon Peres, to the Jewish communities in the Diaspora, on the occasion of the Jewish New Year 5770</em> &gt; &gt; Hopefully, the coming New Year will be marked by the realization of our aspirations: attaining peace, increasing security, promoting economic growth, safeguarding the future of the Jewish people and strengthening the ties between Israel and our Jewish brothers in the Diaspora. &gt; &gt; The opportunity to attain peace is beckoning, and must be seized, even at the cost of painful concessions. The Arab world’s intractable position to say “No” to negotiations, “No” to recognition of Israel and “No” to peace, has today been replaced by the three-fold “Yes” to the Saudi Initiative. The international community is keen to support endeavors to move the peace process forward, and I am confident that, with concerted efforts, the vision of a comprehensive peace can be realized. This will create stability, tranquility, security and prosperity for our children and their children after them. &gt; &gt; Nuclear arms in the possession of extremist fundamentalist hands pose a danger to the whole of humanity and not only to Israel. A broad and consolidated stand by the international community against Iran is called for. I pray that this terrible threat be removed from all of humanity and that the world may enjoy a new era of peace and security. &gt; &gt; Israel’s economy is showing the first sparks of recovery from the global economic crisis. The macro-economic signs are promising, and these indications are reflected in a growing scope of investments, the hi-tech industry is reviving and start-up companies are again sprouting. This is the time to seize the opportunity. This is the time to invest in Israel in fields such as alternative energy, water production, homeland security infrastructures, educational and learning-related tools, and in the stem-cell industry. This constitutes the future and it is in our hands. &gt; &gt; It is vital to build with our brethren in the Diaspora ties based on solid foundations of partnership and education. Indeed, the role of Jewish education in the Diaspora cannot be overestimated. It serves as the very building-blocks of the bridges that connect the Jewish communities abroad and Israel. It serves as the terms of engagement between the young generation of Jewish youth and our nation and as the stepping stones to a greater awareness of the significance of Israel-Diaspora relations. It will serve to preserve our rich heritage and traditions. &gt; &gt; The spirit of partnership must be enhanced in every area of Israel-Diaspora relations. We face dramatic challenges, which again underscore the necessity to stand united in moments of trial, responsible one for the other, as dictated by our Prophets. Indeed, a threat to the well-being of Jewish communities in the world equates a threat to Israel itself, and the fate of Diaspora Jewry is at the very core of Israel’s heart. &gt; &gt; Dear Friends, as we embark on this New Year, I want to convey my heartfelt good wishes to all of the Jewish people in the Diaspora, in the hope that it will be a year of joy and good tidings to all. &gt; &gt; And let us pray for the safe return home of the hostages and missing soldiers. &gt; &gt; <em>Shana Tova U’Metukah</em>, &gt; &gt; Shimon Peres</p>
