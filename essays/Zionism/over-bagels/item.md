This one comes from a [Boston blogger](http://www.solomonia.com/blog/boston-event-calendar.shtml) who apparently thinks defending Israel is most properly done by bashing Muslims. The host is a Conservative Jewish congregation's [oxymoronically named] _Brotherhood_ group in Stoughton, Massachusetts. The speakers are an assortment of Islam bashers and miscellaneous wingnuts from both Judaism and Christianity. 

What could be more spiritual and serve the purposes of interfaith relations than bashing a 3rd religion over bagels?
