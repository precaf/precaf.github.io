If anyone thinks that Israel has any intention of sharing Palestine with its existing inhabitants, please read the Peace & Security portion of the Likud's platform:

The Likudniks are still peeved that they never got what they regard as their proper amount of land from the British:

#### Settlements 

The Jewish communities in **Judea, Samaria and Gaza** are the realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel. The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting. 

#### Self-Rule 

**The Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river**. [..] The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but **not as an independent and sovereign state**.

#### Jerusalem 

Jerusalem is the eternal, united capital of the State of Israel and only of Israel. **The government will flatly reject Palestinian proposals to divide Jerusalem**, including the plan to divide the city presented to the Knesset by the Arab factions and supported by many members of Labor and Meretz. [...] The Likud government will **act with vigor to continue Jewish habitation and strengthen Israeli sovereignty in the eastern parts of the city**...

#### The Jordan River as a Permanent Border 

The Jordan Valley and the territories that dominate it shall be under Israeli sovereignty. **The Jordan river will be the permanent eastern border of the State of Israel**. The Kingdom of Jordan is a desirable partner in the permanent status arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians in matters that will be agreed upon. 

#### Security Areas 

**The government succeeded in significantly reducing the extent of territory that the Palestinians expected to receive in the interim arrangement**. The government will insist that security areas essential to Israel's defense, including the western security area and the Jewish settlements, shall remain under Israeli rule. 

#### The Golan 

Based on the Likud-led government's proposal, **the 10th Knesset passed the law to extend Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration over the Golan Heights**, thus establishing Israeli sovereignty over the area. The government will continue to strengthen Jewish settlement on the Golan.
