![The president that Republicans really want](netanyahu-cong.jpg)

Israel's influence is all out of proportion to its objective strategic importance to the United States. Yet because of American religious sentiment and a strong Israel lobby, any attempt to end its occupation or alter its settlement policies are rebuffed, while conversely the tiny nation seems to constantly intrude into our domestic politics.

Israel is an [insignificant trading partner](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/toppartners.html), although every state governor travels there on [a trade mission](https://www.cjp.org/blog/of-missions-economic-and-missions-spiritual) during his term. The state of Israel is not part of NATO, though [NATO has provided it with an office](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-upgrade-to-ties-nato-accepts-israels-official-representative/) in Brussels. No Israeli troops have ever assisted in any US-led military "coalitions" in the Middle East. [Israel serves](http://fpif.org/why_the_us_supports_israel/) as a check to Hezbollah and Syrian power, tests American military equipment, assists in intelligence gathering, and its nuclear weapons can more easily reach Asia and Eastern Europe. Still, [not even NATO allies](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/multimedia/military-spending/) during the height of the Cold War ever received the level of military aid Israel has.

Since its founding Israel has received [more foreign and military aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) than any other nation -- $124 billion as of 2015, plus [another $40 billion](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/06/14/40-billion-aid-to-Israel-is-largest-ever-to-any-country-says-Susan-Rice/5461465914964/) this year. An analysis by the Congressional Research Service describes Israel's unique benefits:

> "Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II. To date, the United States has provided Israel $124.3 billion (current, or non-inflation-adjusted, dollars) in bilateral assistance. Almost all U.S. bilateral aid to Israel is in the form of military assistance, although in the past Israel also received significant economic assistance. Strong congressional support for Israel has resulted in Israel receiving benefits not available to any other countries... In addition to receiving U.S. State Department-administered foreign assistance, Israel also receives funds from annual defense appropriations bills for rocket and missile defense programs. Israel pursues some of those programs jointly with the United States."

Negotiations over Israel's aid package last summer were a lopsided and distasteful affair, with [Israel demanding more money from the United States](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/world/middleeast/us-increase-military-aid-israel.html) and Congress hammering the American president in Israel's behalf.

Although often described as "[the only democracy in the Middle East](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-ruebner/the-only-democracy-in-the_b_833379.html)," Israel's "democracy" extends many rights only to its Jewish majority and punishes Arabs -- from a [right to immigrate only for Jews](http://www.jewishagency.org/first-steps/program/2016) and sixty years of occupation for Arabs; to civil law for Jews but [martial law for Palestinians](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/12/israel-s-perpetual-state-of-emergency.html). On land that has been [expropriated from Palestinians](http://www.btselem.org/) separate roads and services exist only for Jewish settlers. There is also widespread segregation of Jews and Arabs within Israel's own disputed borders and numerous instances of racism and Islamophobia. This has led many to compare Israel with the old South African *Apartheid* system, which never qualified as a democracy, though in 1985 [Ronald Reagan tried to sell it](https://thinkprogress.org/the-right-wings-campaign-to-discredit-and-undermine-mandela-in-one-timeline-3dfdb96d36f1#.hy0tes3hd) as such: 

> "They have eliminated the segregation that we once had in our own country — the type of thing where hotels and restaurants and places of entertainment and so forth were segregated — that has all been eliminated."

Of course, Reagan also said that [ketchup](http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/opinion/three-ronald-reagans.html) was a vegetable.
