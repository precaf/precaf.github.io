<p>The October 7th assault on Israel by Hamas militants was a heinous,
gruesome, and traumatizing act of terror for Israelis who had become
complacent to inevitable resistance from people they have subjugated for
75 years. Despite members of Israel’s new government now speaking openly
of genocide and ethnic cleansing, there was never much doubt that the US
would side with Israel. Americans, who learn their history and geography
only when wars break out, generally have little idea what kind of state
they are funding, or even what kind of conflict this is.</p>
<p>Though almost always painted as a religious war, this last outbreak
of violence is the latest chapter of a long-festering land dispute that
drags on, largely because of the amount of money and weaponry the US
sends Israel to maintain their grip on Palestinians and slowly erase
them from lands they should have had when colonial powers carved up the
Middle East in the wake of World War I.</p>
<p>After the attack, with concern for Israel rarely displayed toward any
other country, a stream of US politicians — congressmen, senators,
mayors, presidents — flew to Tel Aviv to be photographed with Israeli
officials and offer condolences, even as Israel launched a barrage of
over 6,000 bombs into Gaza, killing thousands of civilians
indiscriminately. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel/">announced</a>
a “complete siege” on Gaza’s civilian population (illegal under
international law) and added, “We are fighting human animals and we are
acting accordingly.” Member of Israel’s Knesset Ariel Kallner <a
target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/09/israel-hamas-war-crimes-palestinians/">called
for</a>a “Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of ’48. Kallner was
referring to the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.zochrot.org/articles/view/56529/en?AlNakba">ethnic
cleansing</a> of over 750,000 Arabs in 1948, many of whom fled to Gaza
and have lived in refugee camps for three generations. Similar appeals
to cleanse the West Bank of Palestinians are routine now.</p>
<p>Ignoring these genocidal intentions, 420 congressmen signed a <a
target="_blank" href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MCCAUL_086_xml90.pdf">resolution</a>
supporting Israel without reservation and omitting any mention of war
crimes being committed in reprisal for Hamas’s attack. A parallel House
<a
target="_blank" href="https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bushceasefirenowresolution.pdf">resolution</a>
calling for a pause in Israel’s indiscriminate bombing of civilians and
allowing Gaza to receive humanitarian aid was supported by only thirteen
Democrats — all people of color. Biden’s ambassador to the UN vetoed a
similar <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/us-vetoes-un-resolution-calling-for-humanitarian-pause-in-israel-hamas-war">resolution</a>,
cynically saying “We believe we need to let that diplomacy play out.” As
the US well knows from previous vetoes, only mass civilian casualties
will result from letting missile diplomacy “play out.”</p>
<p>Americans love Israel so much that an Israeli “lobbying” group is
permitted to operate in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-department-of-justice-asked-to-regulate-aipac-as-a-foreign-agent-of-the-israeli-government-88190712.html">violation</a>
of FARA laws and regularly flies congressmen on junkets to Israel. Laws
in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation">37
states</a> punish criticism of Israel. Israel has been the recipient of
the largest amount of foreign and military aid of any ally, <a
target="_blank" href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33222/44">to
date</a> receiving more than $150 billion, with more dished out every
year. The United States reliably <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/19/a-history-of-the-us-blocking-un-resolutions-against-israel">vetoes</a>
any UN resolution critical of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians.
State Department officials regularly speak of “no daylight” between US
and Israeli positions and the two countries’ “unbreakable bond.” Israel
is routinely described as “the only democracy in the Middle East”
although it is no democracy at all for Palestinians inside Israel itself
or in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>Although it’s not clear the love is reciprocated, American love for
Israel is a product of similar history and religion. In addition to the
ethnic cleansing both the US and Israel were founded on, there is also a
religious dimension to the relationship. When Anthony Blinken flew to
Israel after the Hamas attack he <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-767997">told</a> the
Israeli Defense Ministry, “I come before you not only as the United
States secretary of state but also as a Jew.” From the Christian
bleachers Lindsay Graham managed to inject good-ole-boy American racism
into a <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1711922580846702789">call</a>
for genocide on Gazans: “To Cornel West and the Black Lives Matter group
[…] We’re in a religious war here. I am with Israel. Do whatever the
hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place.”</p>
<p>When George Washington stepped down after a reasonable number of
years of service (listen up, Joe!) he left behind his thoughts on
foreign entanglements in his famous <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mountvernon.org/education/primary-source-collections/primary-source-collections/article/washington-s-farewell-address-1796/">Farewell
Address</a>. Warning of precisely “unbreakable bonds” and “zero
daylight” with allies, Washington wrote, “nothing is more essential,
than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular Nations,
and passionate attachments for others, should be excluded; and that, in
place of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be
cultivated. The Nation, which indulges towards another an habitual
hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave.” Washington
could have been speaking of Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>So when progressive Democrat Pramila Jaypal referred not long ago to
Israel as a racist country practicing Apartheid, all hell broke loose.
Republicans seized the opportunity to force a non-binding <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-pass-resolution-backing-israel-jayapal-racist-state-rcna94897">resolution</a>
that read: “(1) the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state;
(2) Congress rejects all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia; and (3)
the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of
Israel.” The second point served to reinforce the taboo of criticizing
Israel – lest one be accused of antisemitism. <a
target="_blank" href="https://truthout.org/articles/only-9-house-reps-vote-against-resolution-denying-israeli-apartheid/">All
but nine Democrats of color</a> voted for the resolution.</p>
<p>To be fair, most white Democrats defend the United States precisely
as they do Israel (<em>we are a good people, this is not who we
are</em>) even though the U.S. was founded on genocide and slavery and
continues to oppress people of color. In the case of Israel, theirs is a
nation with an immense occupation by Jews of an almost equally-sized
population of Palestinians, depriving them of their human and civil
rights for the last 75 years and systematically taking more and more of
their land.</p>
<p>Like the old American Confederacy through Jim Crow days, Israel
promulgates laws to enshrine and reinforce Jewish supremacy and
ethno-religious segregation. The degree of segregation even applies to
Israeli Jews. Haredi women ride <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/world/middleeast/israel-women-rights.html">segregated</a>
buses. Segregated communities are common. Their Supreme Court affirmed
the right of communities to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Razor-thin-majority-of-High-Court-uphold-law-used-to-exclude-Israeli-Arabs-375630">exclude</a>
Arabs, LGBTQ+, and the disabled. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113724468">Vigilantes</a>
attack Arab men dating Jewish women. More than 65 laws <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adalah.org/en/law/index">discriminate</a> against Arab
citizens of Israel – the 20% who were not expelled to refugee camps.</p>
<p>Although Israelis are <em>officially</em> prohibited from entering
Palestinian areas, over 650,000 settlers have already seized land in the
West Bank. Separate highways have been built for settler use only.
Israel may be a <em>nation of laws</em> but Israeli courts are overly
friendly to land-grabbing scofflaws while all Palestinians get is
endless martial law. Life for Palestininans in Gaza and the West Bank is
hell. As an occupier, Israel destroys Palestinian civilian
infrastructure arbitrarily and attacks civilians indiscriminately. In
the West Bank settlers operate with impunity while the government
destroys Palestinian homes, schools, and crops or decides to clear a
village for military purposes – only to turn around and hand it over to
settlers.</p>
<p>Just as in the United States, where Christian nationalism is rapidly
destroying what’s left of our so-called “democracy,” Jewish nationalism,
with its attendant racism and illiberalism, has similarly brought
Israel’s “democracy” to the point of collapse. Almost every Israeli
political party has historically embraced Palestinian expropriation or
expulsion to some degree, but now the most extreme Zionist elements have
“taken the gloves off” and are coming not only for Palestinians but for
secular Jews and their secular values. Suddenly religious settlers are
being recognized for the dangerous fanatics and racists they are.</p>
<p>Israel’s 37th government includes elements from the Kach party, once
banned as a terrorist organization. Former Mossad chief <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-752713">Tamir Pardo</a>
accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “tak[ing] the Ku Klux Klan
and [bringing] them into the government,” equating ministers Itamar Ben
Gvir, Betzalel Smotrich and others with the KKK (which actually operates
in Israel). Netanyahu’s Revisionist Zionism had a long association with
extremism and fascism, long before the founding of the state.</p>
<p>Israel’s extremist government acknowledges that Apartheid is their
goal. Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who once <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/ben-gvir-responds-to-bennett-fine-ill-take-down-baruch-goldsteins-picture/">displayed</a>
a photo of the man who massacred 29 Muslims at prayer in his illegal
settlement home, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/world/israeli-minister-racist-claim-intl/index.html">told</a>
an Arab journalist on Israel’s Channel 12, “excuse me, Mohammed, but
this is the reality. This is the truth. My right to life outweighs your
right to move on the streets.”</p>
<p><img src="yishi.jpg" /></p>
<p>The West Bank Yishi community, which was built on land stolen from
the ethnically-cleansed village of Dayr Aban, used to advertise two-acre
plots with tennis courts and a forest preserve to Americans eager to
emigrate. “Looking for the American Dream in Eretz Yisrael? …. Do you
want American neighbors and immediate access to Bet Shemesh and Ramat
Bet Shemesh schools? …. Does an Arab-free environment sound appealing?
Yishi is miles inside the green line and even further from the nearest
Arab settlement… A place in Israel that comes as dreamed, no
concessions, no compromise.” Its residents would heartily endorse
Alabama governor George Wallace’s declaration, “segregation now,
segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.”</p>
<p>While American politicians ignore the grim reality for Palestinians
and pretend that Israel is a Western democracy, Israelis are much more
willing admit that their country practices Apartheid.</p>
<p>The Israeli human rights organization <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.btselem.org/apartheid">B’Tselem</a> asserts it.
Israeli author <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israeli-author-david-grossman-suggests-israel-has-become-apartheid-688390">David
Grossman</a> has said it. The Israeli anti-occupation group <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.yesh-din.org/en/the-occupation-of-the-west-bank-and-the-crime-of-apartheid-legal-opinion/">Yesh
Din</a> calls the occupation Apartheid. Before he was assassinated by an
extremist from the settler movement, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-1976-interview-rabin-likens-settlements-to-cancer-warns-of-apartheid/">Yitzhak
Rabin</a> called the settler movement a “cancer” and warned that Israel
risked becoming an Apartheid state. In the <a
target="_blank" href="https://forward.com/news/468379/timeline-term-apartheid-israel/">1980</a>’s
Uri Davis, an Israeli activist, and Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli
political scientist, used the phrase. The Israeli <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid">groups</a>
Adalah, B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence, Combatants for Peace, Gisha,
HaMoked, Haqel: In Defense of Human Rights, Human Rights Defenders Fund,
Ofek: The Israeli Center for Public Affairs, Physicians for Human
Rights–Israel and Yesh Din all supported an Amnesty International report
calling Israel’s practices <em>Apartheid</em>.</p>
<p>And who knows better than the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.juancole.com/2023/03/african-downgrades-apartheid.html">nation
of South Africa</a>? South Africa downgraded Israel’s embassy in protest
of Israeli Apartheid and openly <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/26/south-africa-calls-for-israels-proscription-as-apartheid-state">called
Israel</a> an Apartheid state at the UN. Of course, perhaps they were
just sore that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2013-12-11/ty-article/.premium/why-israel-supported-apartheid-regime/0000017f-e3ae-df7c-a5ff-e3fe965a0000">Israel
actually supported South African Apartheid</a>.</p>
<p><img src="soldier.jpg" /></p>
<p>Many other voices recognize parallels with the old South African
system. Last April, for the first time, the venerable journal <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/israel-palestine-one-state-solution">Foreign
Affairs</a> ran an article calling Israel an Apartheid state. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution">Human
Rights Watch</a> considers Israel’s treatment of Palestinians Apartheid.
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/01/1077291879/israel-apartheid-state-amnesty-international">Amnesty
International</a> says so too. The American group <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2022/02/jvp-rabbinic-council-apartheid/">Jewish
Voice for Peace</a> agrees. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://afsc.org/news/why-afsc-uses-term-israeli-apartheid">American
Friends Service Committee</a> uses the term “Israeli Apartheid.” Former
<a
target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/former-chief-israels-treatment-palestinians-constitute-apartheid-100311202">UN
Secretary Ban Ki-Moon</a> cautiously says Israel is “inching” toward
Apartheid. New York Times columnist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/opinion/friedman-newt-mitt-bibi-and-vladimir.html">Tom
Friedman</a> blasted a Republican pro-Israel position as pro- Apartheid.
Marine Corps General <a
target="_blank" href="https://forward.com/opinion/181121/top-us-general-we-pay-a-price-for-backing-israel/">James
Mattis</a> used the term describing Israel’s “democratic” dilemma:
democracy or Apartheid. U.S. Secretary of State <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/israel-apartheid-state-peace-talks-john-kerry">John
Kerry</a> made exactly the same argument. Former Vermont governor and
presidential candidate <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/international/former-vermont-governor-calls-israel-an-apartheid-state-680910">Howard
Dean</a> called Israel an Apartheid state. Former <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/24/jimmy-carter-israel-apartheid-palestine-peace/">President
Jimmy Carter</a> thought so too. He even wrote a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2007/01/25/7004473/jimmy-carter-defends-peace-not-apartheid">book</a>
making the case.</p>
<p>And if compassion for Palestinians is antisemitic, you’d better tell
American Jews. Among respondents of a 2021 survey commissioned by the
Jewish Electorate Institute, a group <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/about/">led by prominent
Jewish Democrats</a>, 34% agreed that “Israel’s treatment of
Palestinians is similar to racism in the United States,” 25% considered
“Israel is an apartheid state” and 22% thought that “Israel is
committing genocide against the Palestinians.”</p>
<p>Yet none of this has managed to reach the ears of Congress or the
President.</p>
<p>House Republicans may have an excuse for the open embrace of ethnic
cleansing and ethno-religious supremacy – that’s just who they are – but
Democrats who refuse to call out a violent occupation and an Apartheid
regime deserve nothing but contempt for their cowardice. In fact, the
defense of racist ethno-religious nationalism in Israel only undermines
Democrats’ credibility if not their ability to fight it here at
home.</p>
<p>The United States has never applied either carrots or sticks to
Israel. Instead we just turn on the spigot and keep the money flowing
for Apartheid. This needs to stop now. Let Israel fund its own
repressive racist regime without our help.</p>
