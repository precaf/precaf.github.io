The October 7th assault on Israel by Hamas militants was a heinous, gruesome, and traumatizing act of terror for Israelis who had become complacent to inevitable resistance from people they have subjugated for 75 years. Despite members of Israel's new government now speaking openly of genocide and ethnic cleansing, there was never much doubt that the US would side with Israel. Americans, who learn their history and geography only when wars break out, generally have little idea what kind of state they are funding, or even what kind of conflict this is.

Though almost always painted as a religious war, this last outbreak of violence is the latest chapter of a long-festering land dispute that drags on, largely because of the amount of money and weaponry the US sends Israel to maintain their grip on Palestinians and slowly erase them from lands they should have had when colonial powers carved up the Middle East in the wake of World War I.

After the attack, with concern for Israel rarely displayed toward any other country, a stream of US politicians — congressmen, senators, mayors, presidents — flew to Tel Aviv to be photographed with Israeli officials and offer condolences, even as Israel launched a barrage of over 6,000 bombs into Gaza, killing thousands of civilians indiscriminately. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant [announced](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel/) a “complete siege” on Gaza’s civilian population (illegal under international law) and added, “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” Member of Israel's Knesset Ariel Kallner [called for ](https://theintercept.com/2023/10/09/israel-hamas-war-crimes-palestinians/)a "Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of '48. Kallner was referring to the [ethnic cleansing](https://www.zochrot.org/articles/view/56529/en?AlNakba) of over 750,000 Arabs in 1948, many of whom fled to Gaza and have lived in refugee camps for three generations. Similar appeals to cleanse the West Bank of Palestinians are routine now. 

Ignoring these genocidal intentions, 420 congressmen signed a [resolution](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MCCAUL_086_xml90.pdf) supporting Israel without reservation and omitting any mention of war crimes being committed in reprisal for Hamas's attack. A parallel House [resolution](https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bushceasefirenowresolution.pdf) calling for a pause in Israel’s indiscriminate bombing of civilians and allowing Gaza to receive humanitarian aid was supported by only thirteen Democrats — all people of color. Biden’s ambassador to the UN vetoed a similar [resolution](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/us-vetoes-un-resolution-calling-for-humanitarian-pause-in-israel-hamas-war), cynically saying “We believe we need to let that diplomacy play out.” As the US well knows from previous vetoes, only mass civilian casualties will result from letting missile diplomacy "play out."

Americans love Israel so much that an Israeli "lobbying" group is permitted to operate in [violation](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-department-of-justice-asked-to-regulate-aipac-as-a-foreign-agent-of-the-israeli-government-88190712.html) of FARA laws and regularly flies congressmen on junkets to Israel. Laws in [37 states](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation) punish criticism of Israel. Israel has been the recipient of the largest amount of foreign and military aid of any ally, [to date](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33222/44) receiving more than $150 billion, with more dished out every year. The United States reliably [vetoes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/19/a-history-of-the-us-blocking-un-resolutions-against-israel) any UN resolution critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. State Department officials regularly speak of "no daylight" between US and Israeli positions and the two countries' "unbreakable bond." Israel is routinely described as "the only democracy in the Middle East" although it is no democracy at all for Palestinians inside Israel itself or in Gaza and the West Bank.

Although it’s not clear the love is reciprocated, American love for Israel is a product of similar history and religion. In addition to the ethnic cleansing both the US and Israel were founded on, there is also a religious dimension to the relationship. When Anthony Blinken flew to Israel after the Hamas attack he [told](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-767997) the Israeli Defense Ministry, “I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew.” From the Christian bleachers Lindsay Graham managed to inject good-ole-boy American racism into a [call](https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1711922580846702789) for genocide on Gazans: "To Cornel West and the Black Lives Matter group [...] We’re in a religious war here. I am with Israel. Do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place."

When George Washington stepped down after a reasonable number of years of service (listen up, Joe!) he left behind his thoughts on foreign entanglements in his famous [Farewell Address](https://www.mountvernon.org/education/primary-source-collections/primary-source-collections/article/washington-s-farewell-address-1796/). Warning of precisely “unbreakable bonds” and “zero daylight” with allies, Washington wrote, "nothing is more essential, than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular Nations, and passionate attachments for others, should be excluded; and that, in place of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. The Nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave." Washington could have been speaking of Israel and Iran.

So when progressive Democrat Pramila Jaypal referred not long ago to Israel as a racist country practicing Apartheid, all hell broke loose. Republicans seized the opportunity to force a non-binding [resolution](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-pass-resolution-backing-israel-jayapal-racist-state-rcna94897) that read: "(1) the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state; (2) Congress rejects all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia; and (3) the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel." The second point served to reinforce the taboo of criticizing Israel – lest one be accused of antisemitism. [All but nine Democrats of color](https://truthout.org/articles/only-9-house-reps-vote-against-resolution-denying-israeli-apartheid/) voted for the resolution.

To be fair, most white Democrats defend the United States precisely as they do Israel (*we are a good people, this is not who we are*) even though the U.S. was founded on genocide and slavery and continues to oppress people of color. In the case of Israel, theirs is a nation with an immense occupation by Jews of an almost equally-sized population of Palestinians, depriving them of their human and civil rights for the last 75 years and systematically taking more and more of their land.

Like the old American Confederacy through Jim Crow days, Israel promulgates laws to enshrine and reinforce Jewish supremacy and ethno-religious segregation. The degree of segregation even applies to Israeli Jews. Haredi women ride [segregated](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/world/middleeast/israel-women-rights.html) buses. Segregated communities are common. Their Supreme Court affirmed the right of communities to [exclude](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Razor-thin-majority-of-High-Court-uphold-law-used-to-exclude-Israeli-Arabs-375630) Arabs, LGBTQ+, and the disabled. [Vigilantes](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113724468) attack Arab men dating Jewish women. More than 65 laws [discriminate](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/index) against Arab citizens of Israel – the 20% who were not expelled to refugee camps.

Although Israelis are *officially* prohibited from entering Palestinian areas, over 650,000 settlers have already seized land in the West Bank. Separate highways have been built for settler use only. Israel may be a *nation of laws* but Israeli courts are overly friendly to land-grabbing scofflaws while all Palestinians get is endless martial law. Life for Palestininans in Gaza and the West Bank is hell. As an occupier, Israel destroys Palestinian civilian infrastructure arbitrarily and attacks civilians indiscriminately. In the West Bank settlers operate with impunity while the government destroys Palestinian homes, schools, and crops or decides to clear a village for military purposes – only to turn around and hand it over to settlers.

Just as in the United States, where Christian nationalism is rapidly destroying what's left of our so-called "democracy," Jewish nationalism, with its attendant racism and illiberalism, has similarly brought Israel's "democracy" to the point of collapse. Almost every Israeli political party has historically embraced Palestinian expropriation or expulsion to some degree, but now the most extreme Zionist elements have "taken the gloves off" and are coming not only for Palestinians but for secular Jews and their secular values. Suddenly religious settlers are being recognized for the dangerous fanatics and racists they are.

Israel's 37th government includes elements from the Kach party, once banned as a terrorist organization. Former Mossad chief [Tamir Pardo](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-752713) accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “tak[ing] the Ku Klux Klan and [bringing] them into the government,” equating ministers Itamar Ben Gvir, Betzalel Smotrich and others with the KKK (which actually operates in Israel). Netanyahu's Revisionist Zionism had a long association with extremism and fascism, long before the founding of the state. 

Israel's extremist government acknowledges that Apartheid is their goal. Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who once [displayed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/ben-gvir-responds-to-bennett-fine-ill-take-down-baruch-goldsteins-picture/) a photo of the man who massacred 29 Muslims at prayer in his illegal settlement home, [told](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/world/israeli-minister-racist-claim-intl/index.html) an Arab journalist on Israel's Channel 12, "excuse me, Mohammed, but this is the reality. This is the truth. My right to life outweighs your right to move on the streets.”

![](yishi.jpg)

The West Bank Yishi community, which was built on land stolen from the ethnically-cleansed village of Dayr Aban, used to advertise two-acre plots with tennis courts and a forest preserve to Americans eager to emigrate. "Looking for the American Dream in Eretz Yisrael? …. Do you want American neighbors and immediate access to Bet Shemesh and Ramat Bet Shemesh schools? …. Does an Arab-free environment sound appealing? Yishi is miles inside the green line and even further from the nearest Arab settlement… A place in Israel that comes as dreamed, no concessions, no compromise." Its residents would heartily endorse Alabama governor George Wallace's declaration, "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."

While American politicians ignore the grim reality for Palestinians and pretend that Israel is a Western democracy, Israelis are much more willing admit that their country practices Apartheid.

The Israeli human rights organization [B'Tselem](https://www.btselem.org/apartheid) asserts it. Israeli author [David Grossman](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israeli-author-david-grossman-suggests-israel-has-become-apartheid-688390) has said it. The Israeli anti-occupation group [Yesh Din](https://www.yesh-din.org/en/the-occupation-of-the-west-bank-and-the-crime-of-apartheid-legal-opinion/) calls the occupation Apartheid. Before he was assassinated by an extremist from the settler movement, [Yitzhak Rabin](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-1976-interview-rabin-likens-settlements-to-cancer-warns-of-apartheid/) called the settler movement a "cancer" and warned that Israel risked becoming an Apartheid state. In the [1980](https://forward.com/news/468379/timeline-term-apartheid-israel/)'s Uri Davis, an Israeli activist, and Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli political scientist, used the phrase. The Israeli [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid) Adalah, B'Tselem, Breaking the Silence, Combatants for Peace, Gisha, HaMoked, Haqel: In Defense of Human Rights, Human Rights Defenders Fund, Ofek: The Israeli Center for Public Affairs, Physicians for Human Rights–Israel and Yesh Din all supported an Amnesty International report calling Israel's practices *Apartheid*.

And who knows better than the [nation of South Africa](https://www.juancole.com/2023/03/african-downgrades-apartheid.html)? South Africa downgraded Israel's embassy in protest of Israeli Apartheid and openly [called Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/26/south-africa-calls-for-israels-proscription-as-apartheid-state) an Apartheid state at the UN. Of course, perhaps they were just sore that [Israel actually supported South African Apartheid](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2013-12-11/ty-article/.premium/why-israel-supported-apartheid-regime/0000017f-e3ae-df7c-a5ff-e3fe965a0000).

Many other voices recognize parallels with the old South African system. Last April, for the first time, the venerable journal [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/israel-palestine-one-state-solution) ran an article calling Israel an Apartheid state. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution) considers Israel's treatment of Palestinians Apartheid. [Amnesty International](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/01/1077291879/israel-apartheid-state-amnesty-international) says so too. The American group [Jewish Voice for Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2022/02/jvp-rabbinic-council-apartheid/) agrees. The [American Friends Service Committee](https://afsc.org/news/why-afsc-uses-term-israeli-apartheid) uses the term "Israeli Apartheid." Former [UN Secretary Ban Ki-Moon](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/former-chief-israels-treatment-palestinians-constitute-apartheid-100311202) cautiously says Israel is "inching" toward Apartheid. New York Times columnist [Tom Friedman](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/opinion/friedman-newt-mitt-bibi-and-vladimir.html) blasted a Republican pro-Israel position as pro- Apartheid. Marine Corps General [James Mattis](https://forward.com/opinion/181121/top-us-general-we-pay-a-price-for-backing-israel/) used the term describing Israel's "democratic" dilemma: democracy or Apartheid. U.S. Secretary of State [John Kerry](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/israel-apartheid-state-peace-talks-john-kerry) made exactly the same argument. Former Vermont governor and presidential candidate [Howard Dean](https://www.jpost.com/international/former-vermont-governor-calls-israel-an-apartheid-state-680910) called Israel an Apartheid state. Former [President Jimmy Carter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/24/jimmy-carter-israel-apartheid-palestine-peace/) thought so too. He even wrote a [book](https://www.npr.org/2007/01/25/7004473/jimmy-carter-defends-peace-not-apartheid) making the case.

And if compassion for Palestinians is antisemitic, you'd better tell American Jews. Among respondents of a 2021 survey commissioned by the Jewish Electorate Institute, a group [led by prominent Jewish Democrats](https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/about/), 34% agreed that “Israel’s treatment of Palestinians is similar to racism in the United States,” 25% considered “Israel is an apartheid state” and 22% thought that “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians.”

Yet none of this has managed to reach the ears of Congress or the President.

House Republicans may have an excuse for the open embrace of ethnic cleansing and ethno-religious supremacy – that's just who they are – but Democrats who refuse to call out a violent occupation and an Apartheid regime deserve nothing but contempt for their cowardice. In fact, the defense of racist ethno-religious nationalism in Israel only undermines Democrats' credibility if not their ability to fight it here at home.

The United States has never applied either carrots or sticks to Israel. Instead we just turn on the spigot and keep the money flowing for Apartheid. This needs to stop now. Let Israel fund its own repressive racist regime without our help.
