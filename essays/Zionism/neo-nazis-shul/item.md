Who am I calling Neo-Nazis? Geert Wilders or the Florida synagogue leaders who invited him? The proper answer is: _both_.

On April 28, 2009, Geert Wilders brought his hate speech to the Orthodox [Palm Beach Synagogue](http://www.pbos.org/) in Palm Beach, Florida. In the speech, Wilders went through his usual laundry list of hate-filled views, including his claim that "Islam is not a religion" and "the right to religious freedom should not apply to this totalitarian ideology called Islam," all to the applause of the audience. Wilders also called for stopping immigration from Muslim countries and urged "voluntary repatriation" to those countries. A [video of the speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpiRHgth5c8) can be viewed online.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on members of the Jewish community to condemn Wilder's hate speech:
  > A synagogue should be the last place that Geert Wilders' Nazi-like propaganda would find a warm reception," said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper. "Members of the Jewish community know all too well what happens when a religious minority is demonized by demagogues. Wilders uses the same scurrilous attacks on Muslims and Islam that the Nazis used against German Jews and Judaism in the 1930s.  

Here's the congregation that defiled their own sanctuary with _sinat chinam_:
