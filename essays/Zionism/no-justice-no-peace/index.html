<p>Israel’s occupation has been ongoing since either 1947 or 1967,
depending on how you count. An indisputable fact is that Israel has kept
Palestinians under martial law for the last 75 years and has steadily
chipped away at land intended to be their national homeland.</p>
<p>Israel and the Western nations, however, have continuously thwarted
Palestinian statehood and winked as endless incursions, assassinations,
land theft, and marginalization has created a <em>de facto</em>
Apartheid state. American politicians speak of their deep commitment to
a “two state” solution, knowing full-well that the land theft has now
progressed so far that, without dismantling the illegal settlements,
“two states” is nothing but a cynical, meaningless slogan.</p>
<p>Much like the US creation of the Taliban, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/07/30/how-israel-helped-create-hamas/">Israel’s
creation of Hamas</a> (which was intended to neutralize the political
power of Fatah and the PLO) has backfired spectacularly.</p>
<p>In 2005 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made the decision to “withdraw”
from Gaza. The Israeli military indeed withdrew from Gaza, but more
controversial and traumatic for Israelis was the decision to physically
dismantle 21 illegal settlements. This was seen as a betrayal of Zionist
ideals by Israel’s far right, which still lists Sharon’s “betrayal” in
its long enumeration of grievances.</p>
<p>Israel’s 2008 war on Gaza, known as “Operation Cast Lead,” killed 3
Israeli civilians and left 10 IDF soldiers dead by “friendly” fire. It
also left vast devastation in Gaza and killed between 759 and 926
Palestinian civilians. A prize-winning photo by AFP photographer

Israeli phosphorus munitions (which melt human bodies) raining down over
a ruined school in Gaza. This was a brutal, disproportionate use of
Israel’s military, which drew widespread international condemnation —
though very little from the United States.</p>
<p>Israel is now in the throes of a crisis of its one-sided democracy.
Amid demonstrations that have exposed fault lines in Israeli society,
the nation formed its 37th coalition government around Netanyahu’s
ultraconservative revisionist Zionist Likud party, Bezalel Smotrich’s
ultranationalist Religious Zionist party, and <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir">Itamar Ben
Gvir’s</a> Neo-fascist Jewish Power party, which openly calls for
expelling all Arabs from Israel and territory that Israel claims.</p>
<p>Ben Gvir’s political base is the old Kach party, which was banned for
its advocacy of terrorism, and consists of extremists from the settler
movement with links to Ygal Amir, who assassinated Israel’s Prime
Minister Yitzak Rabin in 1995, and Baruch Goldstein, who murdered 29
Palestinians at prayer and injured 125 in Hebron in 1994.</p>
<p>Last year Netanyahu and Ben Gvir agreed to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-11-16/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-ben-gvir-agree-to-legalize-west-bank-settlement-evacuated-in-2005/00000184-8245-dd3b-a5bf-c6453bb90000">legalize</a>
settlements frozen, not coincidentally, in 2005. The entire West Bank is
to be Israel’s Wild West. In a nation without a constitution, Israel’s
supreme court is the only obstacle to human rights abuses. And now this
coalition wants to neuter the nation’s court. Liberal Israelis fear the
country is headed toward a future like Hungary’s.</p>
<p>With greater Palestinian suffering and the rise of a more
authoritarian Zionism with fewer restraints and greater territorial
aspirations — this is the dangerous context to this weekend’s invasion
of Israel by an undisciplined group of Hamas fighters who carried out
horrific murders, rapes, assaults and abductions of Israeli and
international civilians in violation of international law.</p>
<p>But as an opinion piece by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/attack-hamas-israel-unprovoked-experts-inaccurate-palestine_n_6522e4cee4b0a32c15bef863">Sanjana
Karanth</a> reminds us, the Hamas attack may have been sadistic,
indiscriminate and illegal. But to consider it totally “unprovoked” is
to ignore 75 years of Israeli repression and Palestinian suffering.</p>
<p>As I watched videos of Hamas fighters moving systematically
house-to-house in Sderot, it reminded me of the many videos I’ve seen of
IDF troops moving house-to-house in Palestinian villages. It is likely
that the Hamas kidnappings were intended in some twisted way to parallel
Israel’s arrests, removal to Israeli soil, and indefinite imprisonment
of Palestinians, arrested without warrant and imprisoned without court
proceedings.</p>
<p>In <a
target="_blank" href="https://precaf.github.io/essays/Personal/palestine-visit/index.html">2009</a>
I visited Israel and Palestine. I saw one of Israel’s physical Apartheid
walls with my own eyes, the dehumanizing checkpoints, and I got a sense
of the grim reality and deprivations for Palestinians. I visited a
refugee center that generations of Palestinians have had to call home. I
also visited an illegal settlement so large and so “American” that it
was indistinguishable from an Orange County suburb with its ACE Hardware
store and a community college. I visited Hebron and met an
ultranationaist settler whose zealotry and violent fantasies alarmed me
more than walking around Ramallah unchaperoned looking for a lunch
spot.</p>
<p>In Sderot, which this weekend was ravaged by the Hamas invasion, I
met with <em>Mizrachi</em> (Jews from Arab countries) peace activists
who used to go into Gaza City to shop and who described the widespread
PTSD of adults and children who have to hide in safe rooms. At the Zikim
kibbutz, which was also breached by Hamas, I met with lefty Jews like me
who sympathized with the plight of Palestinians despite being shelled. A
huge concrete shield is built over the kibbutz’s daycare center to
protect it from ketusha rockets fired so often that a cheeky
rockets-to-ploughshares menorah was constructed out of the spent
cylinders.</p>
<p>Everyone I met on that visit were all dear people, all precious
lives. For everyone, Israelis and Palestinians alike, I want what we
should all have – peace, enough to eat, security, a future for children
and grandchildren. But for both Palestinians and Jews there can be no
peace so long as Israel and Western nations (themselves no strangers to
colonialism) wink at Israel’s colonial oppression and refuse to
recognize the explosive potential of an oppressed people rising up in
frustration because no one cares about them.</p>
<p>Once again this week we saw that potential.</p>
<p>As Israel’s “pro-democracy” movement suggests, Israelis themselves
are beginning to understand that a state only for Jews with laws that
privilege only Jews cannot ultimately even be a democracy for Jews. Just
as white Americans have started to acknowledge this truth and our own
history of genocide, slavery, and Jim Crow, many Israelis are beginning
to grapple with the realization that Zionism is not so different from
good old-fashioned American white supremacy. It might help that many are
former Americans who emigrated.</p>
<p>The long-awaited Third Intifada has finally broken out. The old
slogan “no justice, no peace” seems particularly apt. Palestinian
desperation and Israeli insecurity will be permanent features of
Israel’s Apartheid state unless there is sufficient American and
international pressure on Israel to abandon its vast illegal settlements
to finally enable a Palestinian state to become a reality.</p>
