I just came across an organization in Stoughton called the [No Place for Hate Committee](http://www.noplaceforhate-stoughton.org/). Interestingly, it's a project of the Anti-Defamation League, which should be a bit sensitive to religious hatred.

**I wonder if they know there's a big problem with Islamophobia right in town?**

Specifically, the Ahavath Torah congregation, which has run a welcome for Dutch racist [Geert Wilders](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5718039.ece), whom Britain had the good sense to keep from spewing hate speech there, and also a kaffee klatch with an author promoting her book, [Allah is Dead](https://wrongtrack.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/islamophobia-over-bagels/).

Stoughton also experienced the famous [Danish Flag Incident](http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/02/09/showing_of_danish_flag_roils_town/) in 2006, when Town Manager Mark Stankiewicz felt compelled to fly the Danish flag alongside Old Glory to thank the Danes for running the equally famous Muhammad cartoon.

Feel free to call the town and inquire what, if anything, the No Place for Hate Committee is doing. You can reach Mark Stankiewicz at +1 (781) 341-1300, Ext. 211, [twnmgr@stoughton-ma.gov](mailto:twnmgr@stoughton-ma.gov).
