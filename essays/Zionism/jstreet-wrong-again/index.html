<h1 class="title">JStreet again calls it wrong on Iran sanctions</h1>

<p>J Street today applauded increased sanctions on Iran at the UN. An enrichment processing proposal brokered by Turkey and backed by Brazil, which had previously been acceptable to the United States, was rejected by the US in backing Israel’s demands for sanctions on Iran. A J Street <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jstreet.org/blog/?p=1099">press release</a> supported the move:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>J Street welcomes the passage of enhanced multilateral and broad-based sanctions on Iran at the United Nations Security Council today.</p>
<p>This vote would not have been possible without the tireless diplomatic efforts of the Obama Administration. We commend President Obama and his team for their effort and this step in the right direction, and urge them to continue employing a dual track approach - meaningful engagement plus multilateral sanctions - to convince Iran to change course.</p>
<p>Today, the Government of Iran hears a clear message from the international community that there are real consequences to continued obfuscation, delay, and intransigence over its nuclear program, as well as real benefits should they fully address international concerns.</p>
<p>We expect the Iranian regime to immediately make clear it is not pursuing nuclear weapons, to submit to international inspections, and to end its support for groups that use violence and terror against Israel. Such action will put Iran on the road to reintegration into the international community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="down1.png"><img src="down1.png" title="Thumbs down" alt="Thumbs down" /></a></p>
<p>Other nations seem to be held to a different standard than Israel on nuclear weapons. J Street has not called on the UN for an end of Israel’s formal policy of nuclear ambiguity/obfuscation or asked it to rejoin the world community in respecting the international laws it continues to break. Such lopsided resolutions are guaranteed only to ratchet up the rhetoric from Teheran and make the Iranian regime more unpredictable.</p>
<p>These sanctions are particularly stupid because there was an opportunity to try a reprocessing scheme the US had once supported and to insist on monitoring access. Teheran had warned that the offer would be off the table if sanctions were imposed, and this now gives them a domestic popularity boost in standing up to the United States. There will also now be no monitoring, and Iran will have scored points for its home team.</p>
<p>The imposition of sanctions, however ineffective they are expected to be, coupled with the attack on the Mavi Marmara, is also a setback for NATO ally Turkey and a gain for Israel. A message certainly not lost on certain Middle Eastern and new European allies, these sanctions make it crystal clear that the United States is willing to betray NATO allies and friends when it comes to Israel. <a target="_blank" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/06/09/two_unrelated_thoughts_from_paris">Stephen Walt</a> calls it right when he cites Stephen Cook of the Council of Foreign Relations complaining about how Turkey needs to be “kept in its lane.” We can’t have just <em>anybody</em> running around being a regional power broker in the Middle East. There’s already a reserved seat.</p>
<p>This move is also exceptionally misguided because it further complicates the United States’ relations with other nations in the Middle East. But the president, the State Department, and apparently J Street, all continue to see the world as it was during the Bush administration. The US with the help of Israel will continue to try to project its power in the Middle East - at least for a few more years. Other regional players need not apply for the job.</p>
