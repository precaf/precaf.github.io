<p>Last February Massachusetts state representative Steven Howitt
(R-Seekonk) filed <a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H1558/">H.1558</a> (“An Act
relative to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition
of antisemitism”) which, like a recent U.S. House Resolution, seeks to
define any criticism of Israel as antisemitic. The Massachusetts bill
declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term ‘Antisemitism’ shall have the same meaning that is endorsed
by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which shall mean a
certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward
Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are
directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property,
toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howitt’s description is incomplete if not intentionally dishonest.
While the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism">International
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance</a> (IHRA) definition, originally
concocted by Israel’s Foreign Ministry, <em>does</em> enumerate actual
manifestations of antisemitism found in the politically-neutral <a
target="_blank" href="https://jerusalemdeclaration.org/">Jerusalem Declaration</a>, much
of the IHRA’s definition centers on Israel and Zionism and is intended
to weaponize any criticism of Israel, particularly to criminalize the
Boycott, Sanctions, and Divestment (BDS) movement.</p>
<p>Anti-BDS legislation, which <a
target="_blank" href="https://ccrjustice.org/massachusetts-legislative-advocacy-opposing-anti-bds-bills">threatens
Americans’ First Amendment rights</a>, is now found in 37 states. How
such bills can even be filed boggles the mind. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/naacp-v-claiborne-hardware-co/">right
of Americans to boycott was affirmed by the Supreme Court</a> in 1982 in
<em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.</em> Fortunately, most Massachusetts
legislators have had the good sense to reject anti-democratic bills like
these, as they ought to reject the adoption of a weaponized, revisionist
definition of “antisemitism.”</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://jerusalemdeclaration.org/">Jerusalem
Definition</a> of antisemitism <em>explicitly rejects</em> several
elements of the IHRA definition Israel and Zionist groups use for
transparent political purpose. Regarding Israel (and not Jews), the
Jerusalem Definition says:</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><em>Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant
of their political, national, civil and human rights, as encapsulated in
international law.</em></li>
<li><em>Criticizing or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism, or
arguing for a variety of constitutional arrangements for Jews and
Palestinians in the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean.
It is not antisemitic to support arrangements that accord full equality
to all inhabitants “between the river and the sea,” whether in two
states, a binational state, unitary democratic state, federal state, or
in whatever form.</em></li>
<li><em>Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its
institutions and founding principles. It also includes its policies and
practices, domestic and abroad, such as the conduct of Israel in the
West Bank and Gaza, the role Israel plays in the region, or any other
way in which, as a state, it influences events in the world. It is not
antisemitic to point out systematic racial discrimination. In general,
the same norms of debate that apply to other states and to other
conflicts over national self-determination apply in the case of Israel
and Palestine. Thus, even if contentious, it is not antisemitic, in and
of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including
settler-colonialism or apartheid.</em></li>
<li><em>Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent
forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are
not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.</em></li>
<li><em>Political speech does not have to be measured, proportional,
tempered, or reasonable to be protected under Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights or Article 10 of the European
Convention on Human Rights and other human rights instruments. Criticism
that some may see as excessive or contentious, or as reflecting a
“double standard,” is not, in and of itself, antisemitic. In general,
the line between antisemitic and non-antisemitic speech is different
from the line between unreasonable and reasonable speech.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s say it again –</strong> <strong><em>opposing Zionism,
criticizing or boycotting Israel is not antisemitic</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Long before the establishment of the State of Israel — and long after
— there has been considerable disagreement about the nature of the
Israeli state, <em>especially</em> among Jews.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism rejected Zionism until the establishment of Israel,
and Jews like Hannah Arendt, Martin Buber, Judah Magnes, and Albert
Einstein voiced numerous criticisms of the Zionist founders of Israel.
For over a century even Zionists themselves have warned of the dangers
of harshly treating Arab neighbors in Palestine. For example, see Hannah
Arendt’s articles in <em>Aufbau</em>, recorded in her “Jewish Writings”
(ISBN <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2700764-the-jewish-writings">9780805211948</a>)
.</p>
<p>Zionism and the nature of the Jewish State have long been a
polarizing issue within Reform Judaism. The American Council for Judaism
is a contemporary anti-Zionist organization that formed after Reform
Judaism abandoned its previous condemnation of Zionism (see Thomas A.
Kolsky’s “Jews Against Zionism” (ISBN <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1611412.Jews_Against_Zionism">9781566390095</a>).</p>
<p>Today anti-Zionist Jews include people from the Reform,
Reconstructionist, Havurah, Humanist, and Masorti movements, even some
Orthodox sects such as the Satmars and Neturei Karta. One public
intellectual, Peter Beinart, a modern Orthodox Jew, was once a
well-known Zionist but has since joined the anti-Zionist camp. The most
likely anti-Zionist Jews today are young people who grew up embracing
the promises, if not the reality, of American democratic values, not
racist ethnocentrism. There are <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_anti-Zionist_organizations">dozens</a>
of organizations in the United States, Europe, and even Israel who
represent these overwhelmingly young Jews, among them Jewish Voice for
Peace and Not In Our Name.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Americans have a Constitutional right to
disagree about foreign policy. <em>Should we fight with Taiwan if China
invades? Should we have expanded NATO after Gorbachev? Should we have
invaded Iraq? Is India a democracy?</em> As with any of these examples,
Americans ought to be free to hold an opinion on whether Israel is a
democracy or not, whether its treatment of Palestinians respects human
rights and human dignity, and whether we ought to continue pumping
billions of dollars into the economy of a nation that keeps millions of
people caged in concentration camps.</p>
<p>Most controversial of all, should Americans support the continued
existence of Israel as an illiberal ethnocracy or are we free to
advocate for a <em>true</em> democracy “from river to the sea”?
Anti-Zionists answer this question with a call for freedom — while those
who promote the IHRA definition dishonestly characterize any call to
abandon Zionism’s inherent racism and colonialism as somehow advocating
a second <em>Shoah</em>.</p>
<p>As it happens, the IHRA definition has a long and twisted history. It
was concocted by an extremist settler, Natan Sharansky, ideologically
related to settler extremists Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich who
serve in Netanyahu’s coalition government. Sharansky’s definition of
antisemitism wended its way from the Israeli government to an Israeli
think tank, to Zionist advocacy groups, to the US State Department, only
to be subsequently weaponized against the Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions (BDS) movement. A short chronology:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>1978</em>: For many years the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.hlrn.org/img/documents/USSDLegalAdvisorHansell_ltr.pdf">Hansell
Memo</a> was the policy of the United States in terms of illegal Israel
settlements. “While Israel may undertake, in the occupied territories,
actions necessary to meet its military needs and to provide for orderly
government during the occupation, for reasons indicated above the
establishment of the civilian settlements in those territories is
inconsistent with international law.”</li>
<li><em>1986</em>: Soviet Refusenik Natan Sharansky is released in a
prisoner exchange and moves to Israel</li>
<li><em>1995</em>: Sharansky founds the Yisrael BaAliyah Party to
advocate for the eventual absorption of 2 million Russians, many not
Jewish, as a demographic offset to rising Arab population growth. He
holds a variety of governmental posts.</li>
<li><em>1999-2005</em>: Sharansky serves as Deputy Prime Minister of
Israel, Minister of Housing and Construction, Interior Minister, and
Minister of Industry and Trade. Sharansky becomes Israel’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_without_Portfolio">Minister
without Portfolio</a>, responsible for Jerusalem’s social and <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora">Jewish diaspora</a>
affairs. In this position, Sharansky chairs a secret committee that
approves the confiscation of <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem">East Jerusalem</a>
property of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank">West
Bank</a> Palestinians.</li>
<li><em>2005</em>: Sharansky resigns from Ariel Sharon’s cabinet in
protest of the Prime Minister’s withdrawal from Gaza.</li>
<li><em>2005</em>: Sharansky invents <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-s05.htm">the New
Anti-Semitism</a> (<em>his</em> term). This innovation includes the “3D
Test” – <em>demonization, double standards, delegitimization</em>. The
definition eventually finds its way into the EU working definition and
then, after being dropped by the EU, is recycled by the IHRA. As
employed today, “demonization” can refer to any type of condemnation of
Israel. Avoiding “double standards” requires that, as the only Jewish
state in the entire world, Israel must not be criticized. And
“delegitimization” means that Israel has a <em>right to exist in any
form — even as a repressive state</em>. Hence, criticism of Israel’s
Apartheid system, for example, is off-limits if since calls into
question Israeli self-determination, regardless of the form.</li>
<li><em>2005</em>: The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights
develops a working definition of antisemitism in conjunction with the
Wiesenthal Center. It doesn’t take long before <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301080434/http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8776547&amp;ct=13381863">that
definition is misused to smear critics</a> of Israel.</li>
<li><em>2005</em>: The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-drops-its-working-definition-of-anti-semitism/">EU
drops the use</a> of the working definition precisely because it is so
political, igniting anger from Israel.</li>
<li><em>2010</em>: Israeli Think Tank, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reut_Group">Reut Group</a>, creates
a “conceptual framework [as a] response to the assault on Israel’s
legitimacy.” Reut has specifically studied critiques of South African
Apartheid in order to develop a <a
target="_blank" href="https://gidigrinstein.net/building-a-political-firewall-against-israels-delegitimization-conceptual-framework/">political
firewall</a> against so-called “delegitimization” of Israel.</li>
<li><em>2010</em>: Israel’s National Security Council determines that <a
target="_blank" href="https://cnpublications.net/2011/03/07/new-arab-state-would-delegitimize-israel/">a
Palestinian state will delegitimize Israel</a> — hence both Palestinians
and supporters of a Palestinian state are by definition
<em>antisemitic</em>.</li>
<li><em>2010</em>: President Barak Obama and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3968575,00.html">endorse
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s demand</a> that Palestinians recognize
Israel’s “right” as a Jewish state. HIllary Clinton begins using the
draft version of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)
definition in her State Department.</li>
<li><em>2016</em>: If at first you don’t succeed… The International
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance announces its working definition of
“antisemitism” which includes Sharansky’s 3D test and recycles the EU’s
working definition. The Pompeo <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.state.gov/defining-antisemitism/">State Department
formally adopts the IHRA definition</a>.</li>
<li><em>2018</em>: Israel approves the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-text-of-jewish-nation-state-bill-set-to-become-law/">Jewish
Nation-State Law</a> affirming that Israel is not only a <em>Jewish
state</em> but “a state for all Jewish people.” The Law also establishes
“Jewish settlement as a national value” and mandates that the state
“will labor to encourage and promote its establishment and development.”
When the law is passed, Arab parliamentary members rip up copies of the
bill and shout, “Apartheid,” on the floor of the Knesset (Israel’s
parliament). United States Secretary of State (under Trump) Michael
Pompeo voids the Hansell memo.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IHRA definition is not benign. It is intensely political and the
creation of an Israeli extremist in a previous extremist government who
then turned it over to a think tank tasked with weaponizing it. The
purpose of the IHRA definition is to pervert the natural meaning of
antisemitism (baseless hatred of Jews) and punish any criticism of
Israel or the nature of the Israeli state.</p>
<p>For any legislature to regulate what is “acceptable” speech is not
only a violation of civil liberties but also (when directed at
anti-Zionist Jews) both laughable and antisemitic.</p>
<p><em>Yes</em>, <em>antisemitic</em> because for any legislative
committee to hold a preconceived notion of what all Jews believe, or
ought to believe, is the very definition of antisemitism.</p>
