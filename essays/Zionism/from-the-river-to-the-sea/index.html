Poster in Wing’s Court, New Bedford (Author, 2023)
</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/allegation-river-sea-palestine-will-be-free">considers</a>
the call for Palestinian liberation — “from the river to the sea” — to
be both anti-semitic and an endorsement of terrorism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This rallying cry has long been used by anti-Israel voices,
including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the
PFLP, which seek Israel’s destruction through violent means. It is
fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan
River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the State of
Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state. It is an
antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination,
including through the removal of Jews from their ancestral
homeland.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s not quite so simple as the ADL would have it, and
accusations like theirs are symptomatic of a new McCarthyism that
demonizes people who recognize that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
simply cannot continue without a just resolution, and that the root
cause has always been the injustice of oppressing Palestinians.</p>
<p>Setting aside for a moment the terror required to subjugate millions
of people for three generations in prisons, reservations, city-sized
ghettos, or refugee camps weaponized into concentration camps, let’s
consider the terror of only the last month.</p>
<p>Long before we heard an Israeli general call Palestinians <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-defense-minister-human-animals-gaza-palestine_n_6524220ae4b09f4b8d412e0a">human
animals</a> and long before our jaws dropped as a member of the Knesset
demanded a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israeli-official-calls-for-doomsday-nuclear-strike-on-gaza-that-will-shake-middle-east/ar-AA1i2PfS">doomsday
nuclear strike</a> on Gaza, <a
target="_blank" href="https://statistics.btselem.org/en/all-fatalities/by-date-of-incident?section=overall&amp;tab=overview">fatalities</a>
related to Israel’s occupation were already over 10,000. Craig <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24103463-craig-mokhiber-resignation-letter">Mokhiber</a>,
a UN human rights official who recently resigned in protest, called
Israel’s actions in Gaza “a text-book case of genocide.” US State
Department Political-Military affairs analyst Josh <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/politics/state-department-official-resigns-israel-gaza/index.html">Paul</a>
resigned in protest over US aid to Israel, while State Department
foreign affairs specialist Sylvia <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/04/genocide-biden-gaza-ceasefire">Yacoub</a>
wrote a policy dissent, warning that the US is “complicit in [Israeli]
genocide.”</p>
<p>Plans for dropping the <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/ethnically-cleanse-gazans">entire
population</a> of Gaza in the Sinai desert — which an intelligence
report called the “final rehabilitation” — were published in even the
Israeli news. And now that Israel has surpassed Hamas’s terror by
slaughtering <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">another
10,000</a> civilians (with another 2,200 missing and presumed buried
under rubble) and has imprisoned 10,000 Palestinians without charges
versus the 200 kidnapped by Hamas, it’s clear that the winner of the
terror sweepstakes is Israeli state terror — aided, abetted, and funded
by US tax dollars.</p>
<p>Subject to steady encroachment by violent fundamentalist settlers who
refer to it as <em>Judea</em> and <em>Samaria</em>, the West Bank has
for decades avoided total annexation by Israel and represents an
inconvenient impediment to a contiguous span of entirely Israeli
territory. If Israel’s extremist government succeeds in their stated
goal of <a
target="_blank" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/08/israel-palestine-west-bank-annexation-netanyahu-smotrich-far-right/">full
annexation</a> of the West Bank and completes its task of ethnically
cleansing Gaza, it will mean the death of any sort of
<em>Palestinian</em> state and the denial of self-determination for
Palestinians. But that has been the objective of Zionism since the
beginning.</p>
<p>You’ve got to hand it to the ADL — which has moved over the years
from sounding the alarm on discrimination against Jews to becoming
little more than a pro-Israel mouthpiece — for the consistency of its
hypocrisy. The ADL regards <em>any</em> challenge to or criticism of
Zionism to be anti-semitic. Protests are anti-semitic. Boycotts are
anti-semitic. Calls for freedom and liberation are anti-semitic. Murals
like the one in Wing’s Court, New Bedford (image above), which use the
dreaded phrase must also be anti-semitic.</p>
<p>But is there really anything objectionable in “from the river to the
sea” — other than the obvious shorthand for borders, as Americans might
use “coast to coast” or “sea to shining sea”? Or is it because American
protesters, many of us Jews, are allies in pushing for Palestinian
freedom? Such accusations and pushback from pro-Israel mouthpieces like
the ADL are precisely like the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/08/negrophilia-woke-right-conservative-desantis/">segregationists</a>
who had derisive names for whites who supported civil rights. One was
“race traitor” and the other ended in “—lover.”</p>
<p>As it happens, the word “river” never actually appears in the <a
target="_blank" href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp">original</a>
Hamas Charter, which is indeed an offensive document rivaling equally
offensive Zionist documents like Jabotinsky’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot">Iron
Wall</a> or the propagandistic and racist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/why-jewish-people-are-rightful-owners-land-israel-opinion-1752970">pseudoscience</a>
coughed up by Yair Netanyahu, the Prime Minister’s son and Israel’s Eric
Trump.</p>
<p>But the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot">2017</a>
Hamas Charter does contains two mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Palestine, which extends from the River Jordan in the east to
the Mediterranean in the west and from Ras al-Naqurah in the north to
Umm al-Rashrash in the south, is an integral territorial unit.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and another sentence uses the ADL’s censored words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete
liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the Likud uses similar language in <em>its</em> <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot">1977</a>
platform, which calls for complete <em>Jewish</em> control of <em>all of
Palestine</em> between the river and the sea, and specifically rules out
a Two State solution:</p>
<img src="likud.jpg" />
<p style="font-size:75%; font-style:italic; text-align:center;">
from Jewish Virtual Library
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] will not be handed to any
foreign administration; between the Sea and the Jordan [river] there
will only be Israeli sovereignty.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Israel’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zionist-revisionist-movement">Revisionist
Zionist</a> movement, the progenitor of Netanyahu’s Likud party, had
greater territorial ambitions than a state bounded on the east by the
Jordan River. In pre-1948 posters from the Irgun, the Harut youth
movement, and in fundraising appeals to North American Zionists and
others, Revisionist Zionists used a verse from <em>Bereshit</em>
(Genesis) 15:18 which refers to the <em>Euphrates</em> river, not the
Jordan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On that day, the Lord formed a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your
seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt until the great
river, the Euphrates river.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That biblical quote appears at the top of the left-most poster shown
below with the caption “Land of Israel” and in another Irgun poster
advocating taking not only the portion of the British Mandate reserved
for Jews and Arabs (west of the Jordan) but Transjordan (present-day
Jordan) as well — by force:</p>

Irgun Poster showing all of Transjordan as “the only solution”
</p>
<p>The Revisionists, and every bible-thumper they appealed to, were no
doubt <em>also</em> familiar with verse 13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And He said to Abram, “You shall surely know that <em>your seed will
be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will enslave them
and oppress them, for four hundred years.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the origins, and whoever has adapted or used it in some
variation, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is now
used by peace activists — anti-Zionist rabbis among them — to signify
liberation and justice for Palestinians in both Gaza (which borders the
sea) and the West Bank (which touches the Jordan but is an occupied
military zone).</p>
<p>For many the phrase is simply an affirmation — long denied — of a Two
State Solution that successive US administrations give frequent lip
service to. For some of us it’s the recognition of both the futility of
Two States and the impossibility of continuing to support an Apartheid
state while denying any kind of statehood to Arabs. A bi-national
secular democracy uniting Jews and Arabs in a single secular state could
be a solution. Israel, as a Zionist nation built on an Apartheid model,
would cease to exist. And so would Hamas’s dreams of an Islamic
state.</p>
<p>In any case, just as Israel still has no Constitution after 75 years,
it also has no internationally recognized, undisputed borders. Perhaps
the best anyone can do is to speak of the river and the sea and the
possibilities of freedom in between.</p>
