The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) [considers](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/allegation-river-sea-palestine-will-be-free) the call for Palestinian liberation — “from the river to the sea” — to be both anti-semitic and an endorsement of terrorism:

> “This rallying cry has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including  supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the PFLP, which  seek Israel’s destruction through violent means. It is fundamentally a  call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the  Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the State of Israel, which  would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state. It is an antisemitic  charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland.”

But it’s not quite so simple as the ADL would have it, and accusations like theirs are symptomatic of a new McCarthyism that demonizes people who  recognize that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict simply cannot continue  without a just resolution, and that the root cause has always been the  injustice of oppressing Palestinians.

Setting aside for a moment  the terror required to subjugate millions of people for three  generations in prisons, reservations, city-sized ghettos, or refugee  camps weaponized into concentration camps, let's consider the terror of  only the last month.

Long before we heard an Israeli general call Palestinians [human animals](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-defense-minister-human-animals-gaza-palestine_n_6524220ae4b09f4b8d412e0a) and long before our jaws dropped as a member of the Knesset demanded a [doomsday nuclear strike](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israeli-official-calls-for-doomsday-nuclear-strike-on-gaza-that-will-shake-middle-east/ar-AA1i2PfS) on Gaza, [fatalities](https://statistics.btselem.org/en/all-fatalities/by-date-of-incident?section=overall&tab=overview) related to Israel’s occupation were already over 10,000. Craig [Mokhiber](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24103463-craig-mokhiber-resignation-letter), a UN human rights official who recently resigned in protest, called  Israel’s actions in Gaza “a text-book case of genocide.” US State  Department Political-Military affairs analyst Josh [Paul](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/politics/state-department-official-resigns-israel-gaza/index.html) resigned in protest over US aid to Israel, while State Department foreign affairs specialist Sylvia [Yacoub](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/04/genocide-biden-gaza-ceasefire) wrote a policy dissent, warning that the US is “complicit in [Israeli] genocide.” 

Plans for dropping the [entire population](https://ehrens.substack.com/p/ethnically-cleanse-gazans) of Gaza in the Sinai desert — which an intelligence report called the  “final rehabilitation” — were published in even the Israeli news. And  now that Israel has surpassed Hamas’s terror by slaughtering [another 10,000](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker) civilians (with another 2,200 missing and presumed buried under rubble) and has imprisoned 10,000 Palestinians without charges versus the 200  kidnapped by Hamas, it’s clear that the winner of the terror sweepstakes is Israeli state terror — aided, abetted, and funded by US tax dollars.

Subject to steady encroachment by violent fundamentalist settlers who refer to it as *Judea* and *Samaria*, the West Bank has for decades avoided total annexation by Israel and  represents an inconvenient impediment to a contiguous span of entirely  Israeli territory. If Israel’s extremist government succeeds in their  stated goal of [full annexation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/08/israel-palestine-west-bank-annexation-netanyahu-smotrich-far-right/) of the West Bank and completes its task of ethnically cleansing Gaza, it will mean the death of any sort of *Palestinian* state and the denial of self-determination for Palestinians. But that has been the objective of Zionism since the beginning.

You’ve got to hand it to the ADL — which has moved over the years from  sounding the alarm on discrimination against Jews to becoming little  more than a pro-Israel mouthpiece — for the consistency of its  hypocrisy. The ADL regards *any* challenge to or  criticism of Zionism to be anti-semitic. Protests are anti-semitic.  Boycotts are anti-semitic. Calls for freedom and liberation are  anti-semitic. Murals like the one in Wing's Court, New Bedford (image  above), which use the dreaded phrase must also be anti-semitic.

But is there really anything objectionable in "from the river to the sea" — other than the obvious shorthand for borders, as Americans might use  "coast to coast" or "sea to shining sea"? Or is it because American  protesters, many of us Jews, are allies in pushing for Palestinian  freedom? Such accusations and pushback from pro-Israel mouthpieces like  the ADL are precisely like the [segregationists](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/08/negrophilia-woke-right-conservative-desantis/) who had derisive names for whites who supported civil rights. One was “race traitor” and the other ended in “—lover.” 

As it happens, the word “river” never actually appears in the [original](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp) Hamas Charter, which is indeed an offensive document rivaling equally offensive Zionist documents like Jabotinsky’s [Iron Wall](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot) or the propagandistic and racist [pseudoscience](https://www.newsweek.com/why-jewish-people-are-rightful-owners-land-israel-opinion-1752970) coughed up by Yair Netanyahu, the Prime Minister’s son and Israel’s Eric Trump.

But the [2017](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot) Hamas Charter does contains two mentions:

> *“Palestine, which extends from the River Jordan in the east to the Mediterranean in the west and from Ras al-Naqurah in the north to Umm al-Rashrash in the south, is an integral territorial unit.”*

and another sentence uses the ADL's censored words:

> *“Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.”*

Interestingly, the Likud uses similar language in *its* [1977](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot) platform, which calls for complete *Jewish* control of *all of Palestine* between the river and the sea, and specifically rules out a Two State solution:

![](likud.jpg)
<p style="font-size:75%; font-style:italic; text-align:center;">from Jewish Virtual Library</p>

> *“Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] will not be handed to any foreign  administration; between the Sea and the Jordan [river] there will only  be Israeli sovereignty.”*

Israel's [Revisionist Zionist](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zionist-revisionist-movement) movement, the progenitor of Netanyahu's Likud party, had greater  territorial ambitions than a state bounded on the east by the Jordan  River. In pre-1948 posters from the Irgun, the Harut youth movement, and in fundraising appeals to North American Zionists and others,  Revisionist Zionists used a verse from *Bereshit* (Genesis) 15:18 which refers to the *Euphrates* river, not the Jordan:

> On that day, the Lord formed a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt until the great river,  the Euphrates river.

That biblical quote appears at  the top of the left-most poster shown below with the caption “Land of  Israel” and in another Irgun poster advocating taking not only the  portion of the British Mandate reserved for Jews and Arabs (west of the  Jordan) but Transjordan (present-day Jordan) as well — by force:

The Revisionists, and every bible-thumper they appealed to, were no doubt *also* familiar with verse 13:

> And He said to Abram, "You shall surely know that *your seed will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will enslave them and oppress them, for four hundred years.*"

Whatever the origins, and whoever has adapted or used it in some variation,  “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is now used by peace activists — anti-Zionist rabbis among them — to signify liberation and  justice for Palestinians in both Gaza (which borders the sea) and the  West Bank (which touches the Jordan but is an occupied military zone).

For many the phrase is simply an affirmation — long denied — of a Two State Solution that successive US administrations give frequent lip service  to. For some of us it’s the recognition of both the futility of Two  States and the impossibility of continuing to support an Apartheid state while denying any kind of statehood to Arabs. A bi-national secular  democracy uniting Jews and Arabs in a single secular state could be a  solution. Israel, as a Zionist nation built on an Apartheid model, would cease to exist. And so would Hamas’s dreams of an Islamic state.

In any case, just as Israel still has no Constitution after 75 years, it  also has no internationally recognized, undisputed borders. Perhaps the  best anyone can do is to speak of the river and the sea and the  possibilities of freedom in between.
