We're at war with everyone. We spy on our own citizens. Our infrastructure is crumbling but nobody wants to pay for the upkeep. We seem headed for a police state or a prison state when we could be educating, healing, and building something together. Civil discourse is no longer civil.

Becoming a more diverse country has people worried. Nativism and Islamophobia are now the "new antisemitism." A Presidential candidate runs openly on a platform of hate. We keep poking our noses in every country of  the Middle East. We live in fear. We hate our neighbors. We've lost sight of what the purpose of a society is. It's every man for himself, and the economic system isn't working for 99% of the country.

There's a lot to say about all this and other topics. These essays are collected from Letters to the Editor and other pieces I've written. Some are posts from other people's blogs.
