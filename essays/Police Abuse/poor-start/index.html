<p>Since the midterm elections I have been behaving myself — relatively
speaking. No long-winded missives or rants for quite some time. But
today I am about to break my streak. There is just too much going on to
to remain silent.</p>
<p>For starters, there are the police who just murdered another black
man, Tyre D. Nichols.</p>
<p>As a New York Times <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/arts/television/body-cam-video-tyre-nichols-watch.html">editorial</a>
argues, we have an <em>obligation</em> to view — to <em>face</em> — each
one of these abuses of police power — the tortures, the beatings, the
tasering, the gassing, the terrorizing of young black men like
Mr. Nichols. Each day in America a dozen civilians are killed by police
— double that if you factor in the asphyxiations and Taser deaths police
inflict on disproportionately people of color.</p>
<p>It can’t go on this way.</p>
<p>We must also acknowledge the humanity, the love of their families,
the talents, the potential, and the hopes of each of these victims.
Nichols, who was just trying to get home when he was intercepted,
dragged from his car, and murdered by a group of thugs with badges, died
with his mother’s name on his lips and left behind a <a
target="_blank" href="https://thiscaliforniakid2.wixsite.com/tnicholsphotography/about">portfolio</a>
of lovely photography. How is his life any different from yours or
mine?</p>
<p>We need to get up off our asses and finally do something to rein in
police abuse. While a few people associated with an organization called
BLM may have taken some wrong turns, let’s not ignore the point — that
Black lives really <em>do</em> matter. Police abuses really <em>are</em>
an epidemic and they put all of us at risk.</p>
<p>Sherrilyn Ifill, the former head of the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund,
wrote an <a
target="_blank" href="https://sherrilyn.substack.com/p/a-response-to-conor-friedersdorf">excellent
response</a> to a piece in the Atlantic by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/01/public-outrage-hasnt-improved-policing/672840/">Conor
Friedersdorf</a>, who pronounced “Black Lives Matter” a dead letter and
argued that public outrage wouldn’t fix bad policing and that,
<em>well</em>, police killings are actually fewer than in the past.
Ifill tore into Friedersdorf’s flabby and execrable arguments by
pointing out that, first of all, the lack of public outrage and apathy
is a white people problem. Moreover, Ifill argues, “Whatever modest
reforms to policing have been adopted [following BLM pressure], were
undertaken after long, pitched battles with those determined to maintain
the status quo.” We saw it in the 100% Democratic Party controlled
Massachusetts state legislature when the police lobby preserved
<em>Qualified Immunity</em> — the license to kill without
consequence.</p>
<p>With the murder of a Black man by five Black cops, many have finally
realized that it is <em>police training</em> and <em>police
institutions</em> which create bad cops — who just happen to police in
racist fashion regardless of their own color. Compounding this is the
fact that police are organized as paramilitary organizations where
target practice is valued more than deescalation, where loyalty to
fellow officers counts more than responsibility to the public. Police
are truly a <em>gang</em> unto themselves. A few years ago a former
California police officer spelled out exactly <em>how</em> the <a
target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@OfcrACab/confessions-of-a-former-bastard-cop-bb14d17bc759">institution</a>
corrupts individuals. In his accounting, no cop can completely escape
becoming an abuser.</p>
<p>Recent demonstrations over <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/what-is-cop-city-atlanta-police-protests-rcna67291">Cop
City</a> in Atlanta and the killing of a protester ought to also make us
all think twice about America’s growing Police State. Over the strenuous
objections of voters, the police lobby succeeded in getting approval for
an 85 acre, $90 million (and growing) facility some have described as
<em>Fantasyland</em> for cops. And a Police State also means that
citizens must be convinced, ham-handedly if necessary, in the eternal
good intentions and necessity of the police. We are constantly reminded,
via well-placed <a
target="_blank" href="https://raindrop.io/ehrens/copaganda-29653621">Copaganda</a>, that
<em>Officer Friendly</em> is our pal. Particularly when he’s a “School
Resource” officer.</p>
<p>In America everything is ultimately connected in some twisted way to
race. In the case of Tyre Nichols’s murder, all five cops were Black.
And in the case of Cop City, the City Council that approved the project
is majority Black and the former mayor who pushed it is herself Black.
Ex-mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is now working — just as ironic as it
sounds — as “Senior Advisor for Public Engagement” in the Biden
administration.</p>
<p>So how do we account for this? Is Bottoms a flaming racist? Is Biden
a flaming white supremacist? Of course not, but the institutions they
work in and <em>through</em>, and to which they have hitched their
fortunes, are most definitely racist. Capitalism, colonialism,
militarism, white supremacy, and authoritarianism — all have built and
corrupted everything they touch. Our Constitution is the rulebook by
which our institutions can stack the game against citizens. Racist laws,
racist institutions, and racist justice operate by that rulebook have
created a nightmare for some of us.</p>
<p>And a culture war is raging about teaching these truths.</p>
<p>We learned this week that the Sports Medicine Committee of the
Florida High School Athletics Association wants to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/highschool/2023/01/19/menstrual-questions-for-student-athletes-why-panel-wants-them-mandatory/11080655002/?gnt-cfr=1">make
mandatory</a> the reporting of menstrual cycles by female student
athletes. The same state — just in time for <em>Black History Month</em>
— has also <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/floridas-ban-on-ap-african-american-studies-explained/2023/01">banned</a>
the College Board’s Advanced Placement course in AP African American
Studies. In fact, Florida teachers now face <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/24/florida-manatee-county-books-certified-media-specialist">felony
charges</a> if they use non-approved textbooks in their classrooms. You
can <a
target="_blank" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23584340/ap-afam-syllabus-watermark.pdf">view</a>
the AP African American History course framework <a
target="_blank" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23584340/ap-afam-syllabus-watermark.pdf">here</a>.
The AP course consists of four principal units: Origins of the African
Diaspora; Freedom, Enslavement, and Resistance; the Practice of Freedom
(including a critical view of Reconstruction); and (most damning)
Movements and Debates (including anti-colonial responses to slavery and
the Civil Rights Movement). Somehow, Florida did not feel the need to
ban <a
target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-european-history">AP
European History</a> which <em>also</em> covers philosophical and
political debates. Just not Black ones.</p>
<p>What Florida Republicans have done is to edit out Blacks from
American history in exactly the same manner that Nazis did in removing
Jews from Germany’s civil service and its cultural institutions. Before
they really got going.</p>
<p><img src="hitlerjugend.jpg" /> <em>Hitlerjugend</em> (Hitler
youth)</p>
<p>If you think Florida is an outlier, you would be wrong. Local school
boards and librarians are under attack by town Republican committees all
over the country. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.aclum.org/en/news/aclu-glad-urge-massachusetts-schools-reject-calls-book-bans">Massachusetts
ACLU</a> points out that a very small minority of ultra-conservatives is
responsible for all the noise. This may or may not be the case, as it
has been my observation that much of this is the work of Republican Town
Committees. Indeed, virtually every Republican in Congress mouths these
same sentiments.</p>
<p>In the Tri-Town area [of SouthCoast Massachusetts] a couple of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/story/news/2023/01/25/orr-school-official-raises-concerns-with-anti-racism-group/69832552007/">Republican
hacks</a> are trying hard to do their own impressions of Florida
Governor Ron DeSantis. Joe Pires worries that Diversity and Equity
committees are harming white students. Pires also doesn’t like library
books that represent the identities and concerns of gay kids. <em>Well,
too damn bad!</em> Schools and libraries are for <em>all</em> the
children in a community — not just for kids whose parents look like
Ozzie and Harriet.</p>
<p><img src="ozzie.png" /> <em>Ozzie and Harriet was a television
program in the 1950’s</em></p>
<p>Joining town Republicans like Pires with precisely the same views and
similarly attacking marginalized members of society are <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/nationalist-social-club-nsc-131">neo-Nazis</a>
and <a
target="_blank" href="https://progressive.org/public-schools-advocate/proud-boys-coming-public-schools-bryant-211019/">Proud
Boys</a> who use physical intimidation as they did recently in Fall
River. If attacks like these on gay and brown and black children and
their families don’t concern you, they are precisely the same tactics
the <em>Hitlerjugend</em> and Brownshirts used in Germany of the
Thirties. As a famous German theologian famously observed, first they
come for the “other”; then suddenly it’s <em>you</em>. Contact the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.sclgbtqnetwork.org/">SouthCoast LGBTQ+ Network</a> if
you want to help fight back.</p>
