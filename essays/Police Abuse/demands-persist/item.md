Demands for police accountability aren't going away in SouthCoast, Massachusetts, no matter what some officials think.

In the absence of progress on police accountability in a legislature with a Democratic supermajority, residents have been attempting to address police abuse at the local level. But at every step of the way they have been thwarted and disrespected by politicians who don't even bother to conceal their contempt for police accountability or those demanding it.

New Bedford City Councilor Brian Gomes has convened another of his "non-listening" session to consider only the PD's Use of Force policies. Bigger issues — qualified immunity, SROs, community review boards with subpoena power — aren't up for discussion. And in any case, neither the Mayor nor the Council care to listen: "The public hearing is not intended to be a forum to engage in debate nor address issues not directly relevant to the policies."

**2020 New Bedford Commission on NBPD Use of Force Policies** Public Hearings on Zoom Wednesday, **December 2nd**, 6:00-7:30pm

United Interfaith Action, which is one of a number of community groups that has been attempting (unsuccessfully) to gain the ear of Fall River and New Bedford mayors, has scheduled two events in both cities:

**UIA Police Reform Community Action** Fall River: Community Action Meeting on Zoom Monday, **November 30th**, 6:30-8:00pm

**UIA Police Reform Community Action** New Bedford: Community Action Meeting on Zoom Thursday, **December 3rd**, 6:30-8:00pm

Legislators — take note.
