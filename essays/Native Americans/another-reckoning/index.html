An Act establishing an Indigenous Peoples Day</h3>
<p><img src="top.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is a bill before the <a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H3191">Massachusetts
legislature</a> asking that Massachusetts join Vermont and Maine in
changing Columbus Day to Indigenous People’s Day. Yet for some reason
several of our local state representatives are hesitant to move the bill
forward. Perhaps they have forgotten the ugly, brutal history associated
with the discoverer of the New World, Cristoforo Colombo, otherwise
known as Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p>In the Fifties every kid could recite the poem, “In fourteen hundred
ninety-two Columbus sailed the ocean blue…” We learned that Columbus had
made an astounding “discovery” of “America” — although it was hardly new
to the Arawak and Taino people who had lived there for millennia. For
them it was simply <em>home</em>.</p>
<p>We learned that Columbus was a Genoan explorer who finally persuaded
a Spanish queen to underwrite his voyages in exchange for a cut of the
plunder. Accompanying Columbus in the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria were
87 men. Encountering the Arawak people on what is now the island of San
Salvador in the Bahamas, Columbus dubbed them “indios” and noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very
quickly whatever we say to them. I think they can very easily be made
Christians, for they seem to have no religion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereupon Columbus immediately enslaved several, forcing them to show
where they had obtained the gold in their earrings. Columbus explored a
few more neighboring islands, including what is now Cuba and Haiti. Upon
his return, the Portuguese royalty were unhappy at the Spanish royalty’s
incursion, so four Papal Bulls (Vatican decrees) were issued to specify
how the two Christian kingdoms would divvy up the spoils.</p>
<p><img src="rape.jpg" /></p>
<p>The following year, a second voyage of 17 ships explored a dozen
other islands. On the island of Santa Cruz Columbus encountered Caribs,
whom they murdered, gutted, and beheaded. The historical record also
includes an account of the rape of a Carib woman by one Michele da
Cuneo, a childhood friend of Columbus.</p>
<p>Spanish troops remaining on the various islands Columbus visited
killed indigenous people at will, forcing them to carry the new
slaveholders on litters, like royalty. As King Leopold of Belgium later
did in the Congo, the Spanish gave native people quotas of gold to bring
to the colonizers. The consequence for failing to deliver was being
maimed or murdered.</p>
<p>By now we all remember the breach of the U.S. Capitol Building by
insurrectionists on January 6, 2021. One of these breaches occurred at
the Rogers Doors on the east entrance to the Capitol. The two doors are
almost 17 feet high and 10 feet wide, made of bronze, each weighing 5
tons. Completed in 1861 by sculptor Randolph Rogers, the doors tell the
story of Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p><img src="doors.png" /></p>
<p>The semicircular panel “Landing of Columbus in the New World” depicts
the terror of native people encountering the heavily-armed Spanish.
Another panel “Columbus’ First Encounter with the Indians” depicts a
rape like the previously-mentioned one.</p>
<p>Howard Zinn may have upset more than a few people when he recounted
the grisly details of European conquest in his history books, but all
this was old history when the Rogers Doors were cast in bronze. At the
time, 1861, the mistreatment, colonization, and enslavement of native
people was seen as inevitable — if not desirable — when creating an
American empire. And 1861 was the very moment in American history in
which the government itself was involved in the genocide and ethnic
cleansing of Native American people.</p>
<p>So here we are in 2022. Rather than continuing to honor Columbus for
what in modern times can only be regarded as war crimes, it’s time we
honored the indigenous people whose old world became our New World.</p>
