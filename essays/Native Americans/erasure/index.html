<p>One of the justifications that supporters of the Dartmouth mascot give for &quot;defending&quot; it is that choosing something else would result in the &quot;erasure&quot; of Native Americans and Native American history. This is a view echoed by one Dartmouth school committee candidate who wrote on her Facebook page: &quot;Our local Aquinnah Wompanoag [sic] Tribe was up against cancel culture.&quot; The candidate&#39;s <em>other</em> platform? &quot;Helping our schools create and maintain a wholesome, safe, environment, [...] get beyond race, [...] oppose indoctrinating children [...] to think a certain way about controversial topics.&quot;</p>
<p>This is in a town that can&#39;t even agree on the wording of an historical sign near a place where indigenous people were sold into slavery.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is the schools themselves. Dartmouth has a woeful track record of teaching indigenous history. One 2020 high school graduate <a target='_blank' href='https://dartmouth.theweektoday.com/article/opinion-recent-graduates-perspective-dartmouth-indians/56941'>wrote</a>, &quot;In my four years of being an Indian, I only was exposed to the mascot in connection to the white people wearing the uniforms.&quot; Dartmouth School Superintendent Gifford seemed to <a target='_blank' href='https://dartmouth.theweektoday.com/article/tribal-members-provide-input-high-school-logo-public-forum/57020'>confirm this</a>, noting that students are taught indigenous history &quot;primarily&quot; in the 3rd grade. One AP History competition called the &quot;Colonial Real Estate Agency Project&quot; involved students trying to &quot;attract more settlers to your region of the colonies [...] persuade your European audience to migrate.&quot;</p>
<p>So if indigenous history is not being taught in the schools, then precisely what history is being erased? Are football teams the only way to remember indigenous people? And if a mascot is a stand-in for history education, what is the mascot actually teaching kids?</p>
<p>There were plenty of answers to these questions at a school committee meeting on March 8th. </p>
<p>Three years ago the Dartmouth School Committee voted 3-2 against holding community hearings on the mascot. But the issue refused to go away, partly because of state legislation to restrict native mascots. So the Committee formed a &quot;Diversity subcommittee&quot; to look at curriculum and they threw in the mascot, which otherwise would have suffocated in the thin air of neglect. March 8th was the subcommittee&#39;s best work.</p>
<p>The leadership of the Aquinnah, pressing hard at both school and town level for exclusive representation on indigenous issues and exclusive control over the &quot;Indian&quot; logo, attacked the subcommittee, calling its members &quot;outsiders,&quot; a view echoed by ultraconservatives both within and close to the leadership. It was only thanks to the Committee chair, Dr. Shannon Jenkins, and other level heads that Wampanoag tribes <em>other</em> than the Aquinnah received invitations to be heard.</p>
<p>And was it ever enlightening.</p>
<p>For years we have heard that the mascot &quot;honors&quot; Native Americans. Pushing back on that narrative, Mashpee Wampanoag members Dawn Blake <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zjDTReoyDc&amp;t=574s'>Souza</a>, Shawna <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zjDTReoyDc&amp;t=931s'>Newcomb</a>, and Brian <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zjDTReoyDc&amp;t=756s'>Weeden</a>; Pokanoket Wampanoag council member Megan <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zjDTReoyDc&amp;t=1436s'>Page</a>; and Aquinnah Wampanoag member Brad <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zjDTReoyDc&amp;t=2013'>Lopes</a> explained in thoughtful detail why mascots and symbols -- even if historically accurate -- harm indigenous people nevertheless.</p>
<p>For years we have heard that no one is offended by mascots, that only &quot;woke&quot; crybabies and &quot;outsiders&quot; want to &quot;cancel&quot; the Dartmouth mascot. There was plenty of testimony on March 8th to lay that one to rest.</p>
<p>And for years we have heard that retiring the mascot would &quot;erase&quot; history -- a laughable assertion from folks who refuse to acknowledge <em>real</em> erasure: genocide, ethnic cleansing, and enslavement of indigenous (and other) people, some right in our own backyard.</p>
<p>Brad Lopes, who spoke for Aquinnah members opposing mascots, provided a perfect example of why &quot;erasure&quot; is a demonstrably false narrative:</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday was the three-year anniversary of the ban of mascots in the state of Maine. And the Wabanaki people are still here. They do not need a mascot to represent them. They do not need a symbol. They do not need an image. They are still here. And their culture and history are brought directly into the classroom because of <a target='_blank' href='https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/bills_120th/billtexts/LD029101-1.asp'>LD.291</a>, which is a state law that requires schools to teach Wabanaki history. <em>That</em> is how you provide some sort of honor to native peoples, some sort of respect, as you will actually form authentic relationships. [...] I would encourage you all to move away from any narratives that have to do with &quot;erasure&quot; [...] A symbol is not the solution, education is. This is something I want you all to strongly consider.&quot;</p>
