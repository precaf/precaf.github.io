<p>I have been filling the gaps in my theatre literacy by tackling plays
of the masters. One who cannot be ignored is Anton Chekhov, whose
stories I have read and loved in both English and German translation. A
volume of twelve of <a

Plays of Anton Chekhov</a> edited and given a new American English
translation by Paul Schmidt is an enjoyable improvement over British
English versions of plays I have read previously on Project
Gutenberg.</p>
<p>A <a

book</a> on Chekhov by Bob Blaisdell <a

in TNR peeks over the young writer’s shoulders at his journals and
correspondence with friends, family, contemporary writers, and theatre
people. As with the plays, both <a

target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12494">journals</a> can be found
on Project Gutenberg. “The Vast Humanity of Anton Chekhov” by TNR writer
Scott Bradfield discusses the author’s supposed apolitical humanism and
where it originated. I’m not totally convinced he was all that
apolitical, however. Chekhov was the grandson of a serf who had
purchased his own freedom and the son of a failed middle class
businessman. But he was also a hard-working physician and early on began
writing potboilers to support his family. Although Chekhov’s connections
to the old aristocracy may have been superficial and of recent vintage,
he certainly knew what audience he was writing for: the dying
aristocracy. As I read Chekhov’s plays, I kept looking for social
commentary. What I found at first was sympathy and humor, then stronger
moral judgment, and finally a medical diagnosis that the aristocratic
patient was not long for this world.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the physician/observer character found in
many of his stories and plays was either saved from the corruption of
the aristocracy — or fully plopped into the muck along with them. Much
of the melodrama and material of Chekhov’s theatre pieces played out in
his own family. His older brother was a drunk and a debt-ridden gambler.
His younger brother took up with a married woman. As in <em>Ivanov</em>,
one of Chekhov’s brothers married a Jewish woman (who had been a nanny).
Chekhov’s parents’ home was repossessed. Chekhov wore himself down like
several of the doctors in his plays to the point that he contracted
tuberculosis in his twenties and died in his early forties. It seems
clear enough: Chekhov wrote what he knew. But he had also joined a club
that would be gone within a generation.</p>
<p>Though he no doubt influenced the trajectory of European theatre, I
don’t share the sentiment that Chekhov was a <em>master</em> of both
short fiction and drama. The fact is, while Chekhov’s <em>stories</em>
are less cluttered and less mannered and can still be enjoyed by a
modern reader, most of Chekhov’s plays have not aged equally well.
Despite Schmidt’s intention to free Chekhov’s plays from the
snobbish-sounding British-isms of earlier translations, the plays
themselves will never be free from Chekhov’s preoccupation with the
rotting Russian aristocracy and the embarrassing histrionics and
conventions of European theatre circa 1900. Nor should we forget that
most of these plays were written for quick cash, just like most of
Chekhov’s short stories.</p>
<p><em>Swan Song</em> (1887) is an awful monologue by a drunken, elderly
actor who can’t decide if he’s over-the-hill or still has that
<em>je-ne-sais-quoi</em>. I guess, as long as you think you’ve still got
it, you do. But there’s not really much more to this play.</p>
<p><em>The Bear</em> (1888) is a farce whose adaptation by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208305.Three_Plays_After">Brian
Friel</a> I read first. An attractive but overwrought widow has decided
to wear black and mourn her husband for the rest of her life, never
leaving her house. But she is intruded upon by a thuggish neighbor who
demands instant repayment of a loan supposedly given to the woman’s dead
husband. The home invader refuses to leave until paid, both characters
demonstrate they have ample backbone, and a duel of honor is about to
occur but is then sidetracked by professions of love from the thug.</p>
<p><em>The Proposal</em> (1888) is another farce marred by histrionics
and melodramatic flourishes no longer in vogue. A young man who is
either a walking catalog of real ilnesses or simply a hypochondriac
visits his neighbor to propose to the man’s daughter. The conversation
with the (inexplicably) eager young woman goes south when they argue
over a property line. Once they resolve to overlook the property line in
order to marry, they are <em>still</em> arguing over dog breeds. As the
couple continues to argue, the prospective father-in-law yells to the
audience: “Bring on the champagne.”</p>
<p><em>Ivanov</em> (1889) is a full-length play in four acts. Ivanov is
a profligate 35 year-old debtor who has married a Jewish woman whose
family disinherited her as a result. As such she has no dowry. And then
she contracts tuberculosis and is not long for this world. But Ivanov is
a congenitally unhappy man for reasons that make no sense to a modern
theatre-goer. Perhaps it’s that his projects and his energies have
spread him too thin, perhaps he’s just a restless guy, or perhaps he’s
just an aristocrat with too much time on his hands, but Ivanov simply
<em>stops</em> loving his wife and resolves to marry another woman as
soon as his present one is dead.</p>
<p>The play features anti-semitic aristocratic idlers that include a
card player, a count, various landowners, and a smug, judgmental
physician. On the day of Ivanov’s second wedding the still-tormented
(for whatever reason) groom argues with his bride, her father, and a
friend about his decision to back out of the marriage. Despite the
glaring fact that it’s in <em>nobody’s</em> interest for this sweet
young woman to marry a financial wreck who was despicably cruel to his
last wife, for <em>no reason at all</em> these friends and <em>her</em>
family still want to see the marriage go ahead. Only the self-tormented
Ivanov himself recognizes how bad the marriage will be, and at the last
moment he hurries out of sight and shoots himself. This is far more
histrionics and melodrama than any modern viewer can stomach. And it
only hints at the perverse world that Chekhov would later indict.</p>
<p><em>A Reluctant Tragic Hero</em> (1889) is another farce that relies
on the trope of the much-abused and henpecked husband. Tolkachov
breathlessly visits his friend Murashkin in a panic. The poor man needs
a gun and is preparing to rough it in the wilderness — all because his
wife and neighbors have tasked him with an impossibly long “Honey, do”
list. The actor who plays Tolkachov recites five pages of frenetic
dialog while guzzling gallons of water and enumerating all the many
reasons for his panic. The punchline, of course, is that his friend
Murashkin manages to calm him down — only to pile on additional errands
of taking a sewing machine and a canary in a cage with him when he
returns home.</p>
<p><em>The Wedding Reception</em> (1889) is another stale little
confection, another farce in which a <em>nouveau riche</em> father hosts
a reception for his recently-married daughter. The old beau shows up, a
fake general is hired to lend respectability to the event, a Greek guest
stumbles over his Russian, and that’s basically what passes for humor
here.</p>
<p><em>The Festivities</em> (1891) is another awful farce. It takes
place in a Russian Savings &amp; Loan. The head clerk and the owner, who
has arranged a recognition ceremony for <em>himself</em>, are joined by
a cast of nitwits who run around sighing and carrying on.</p>
<p><em>The Dangers of Tobacco</em> (1902) is a monologue by a
self-described half-wit who comes before an audience as if he were an
“expert” to speak about the dangers of tobacco. Of course, the man
speaks about everything <em>except</em> tobacco.</p>
<p><em>The Seagull</em> (1895) is a warmly-regarded play for its
supposed introduction of subtext, symbolism, off-stage action, invisible
characters, and other innovations — but didn’t playwrights before
Chekhov employ all of these? Despite multiple readings I never found
<em>Seagull</em> a particularly enjoyable play. The histrionics so
common in the previously-mentioned plays are all present in
<em>Seagull</em>. And the conceits of the idle Russian aristocracy have
not aged well or deserve any more sympathy than the Bolsheviks showed
them.</p>
<p>Chekhov’s experiment with a Shakespearean <em>play-within-a-play</em>
may have been intended to show us how crass philistines reacted to a
brilliant young avante-garde playwright, but Chekhov’s play within a
play featuring glowing devil eyes and stinking sulphur was truly as
ridiculous as the philistines in <em>Seagull</em> thought it was. What’s
more, the first audience to view <em>Seagull</em> had exactly the same
reaction as <em>Seagull’s</em> philistines. So savage was the reaction
to the play that the lead actress was rendered speechless, in subsequent
performances the actors sucked on anti-anxiety drops, and Chekhov almost
gave up writing for the theatre altogether.</p>
<p><em>Seagull</em> features much the same cast of characters as
<em>Ivanov</em> — an older writer seduces a younger woman, and it
includes a rich landowner, a doctor, and various specimens of the idle
rich. In <em>Seagull</em> everyone loves someone they can’t have. All
the characters — and even the <em>audience</em> — are bored and jaded
and exhausted by play’s end. Treplev is a terrible but earnest young
playwright who loves Nina, who in turn falls in love with the famous
hack writer, Trigorin, who is in a relationship with a shallow
conventional theatre actress, Arkadina, who is the mother of
Treplev.</p>
<p>Treplev shoots a seagull, a symbol of Nina’s attraction to a world
she can only admire. Trigorin tells Nina he is inspired to write a story
about a girl who is destroyed by a man, just as Treplev has casually
destroyed the seagull’s life. Nina and Trigorin fall in love, Nina
decides to make a go of acting in Moscow and — <em>long story short</em>
— Trigorin cheats on Arkadina, runs off with Nina, impregnates and
deserts her, the baby dies, he returns to Arkadina, and he ruins Nina’s
life. Nina eventually comes back and meets Treplev again, who by now is
a famous writer and still carries a torch for her. But Nina (again, out
of a logic found only in vaudeville) proclaims she still loves Trigorin
<em>despite everything</em> and — <em>boom!</em> — Treplev shoots
himself in the head. <em>Again</em>. And it is up to Chekhov’s reliable
narrator, Dr. Dorn, to tell us that <em>this time</em> it’s probably
fatal. <em>Curtain</em>.</p>
<p>Chekhov seems to have been conflicted about what sort of play he was
writing. On the one hand, <em>Seagull</em> had some artistic
pretensions. On the other, it was still essentially a Russian
<em>telenovela</em>. Judging by the many descriptions of past
productions and adaptations, to this day no one is 100% sure if
<em>Seagull</em> is a tragedy or a comedy. It has <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/saoirse-ronan-and-a-great-cast-cannot-make-the-seagull-work-as-a-film-1.3617819">defied</a>
successful transplantation to the silver screen. And for very good
reason. It’s a bit of a mess.</p>
<p><em>Uncle Vanya</em> (1896) is another melodrama of unrequited love,
and (again) it involves a doctor and bored and depressed aristocrats.
Uncle Vanya’s now-deceased mother has married Professor Serebriakov, a
pompous art history professor and a bit of a fraud. Her daughter Sonya
and mother Maria continue to live on her estate and Sonya (for the most
part) runs it because Vanya is increasingly found drinking himself into
a stupor with his friend, the doctor. Maria’s son Vanya (Sonya’s “uncle
Vanya”) as a young man was impressed by and totally dedicated to
Serebriakov. Now the old and infirm professor has remarried the young
and lovely Yelena, leaving Sonya (and to a lesser extent Vanya) to the
day-to-day management of the estate.</p>
<p>The play begins as Vanya has suddenly realized he (and this applies
to Sonya as well) have wasted their whole lives serving Serebriakov.
Vanya, now 47, has been enamored of Yelena for a decade but objectively
he is too old for her and never once expressed his feelings to her
before she married. And Sonya has admired the self-pitying Dr. Astrov
(who tends Serebriakov’s many illnesses) from afar for at least six
years. Vanya tries but can’t persuade the constant Yelena to leave
Serebriakov, and Sonya finally asks Yelena to find out if Astrov has any
interest in her (turns out, the shallow doctor doesn’t because he has a
thing for Yelena himself and expresses his interest to her in rather
crude terms).</p>
<p>All this self-inflicted misery and hypocrisy from people who have it
far better than the peasantry is infuriating and tiring. Astrov pities
himself for the trauma of seeing newly-freed serfs sicken in hovels they
share with their pigs or die of farm and mining accidents and typhus.
Both he and Vanya drink excessively, and the selfish Serebriakov is
about to leave everyone in uncertainty by selling the 26-room estate for
mutual funds and buying a condo in Finland. As Yelena puts it in Act
Three: “The despair and boredom around here, these grey smudges of
people: they’re so petty. All they know how to do is eat, sleep, and
drink —.” Well, that’s the essence of <em>Uncle Vanya</em> in a
nutshell.</p>
<p>Chekhov subversively hid uncomfortable truths about the Russian
aristocracy in plain sight as he humored them with the love triangles
they loved so much. Chekhov’s Russian aristocrat characters watch their
world turn to shit by their own hands as Russian aristocrats in the
audience applaud.</p>
<p>In the end, Vanya has it out with Serebriakov, even taking the by-now
obligatory Chekhovian gun in hand and unsuccessfully firing it. In rage,
Vanya screams, almost Brando-style: “I coulda been contender!” Actually,
what Vanya says is “I could have been a Schopenhauer… another
Dostoevsky!” Chekhov was right to describe the play as a farce. In Act
Four Vanya has stolen morphene from Astrov and intends to kill himself.
Serebriakov and Yelena are leaving for Harkov and Yelena and Astrov have
final words. They admit some small mutual attraction but that a
relationship would have been a disaster for both of them, and then
Astrov signs off with <em>finita la commedia</em> (end of the comedy).
<em>Again</em> Chekhov tells us this has all been a farce.</p>
<p>Serebriakov departs with the admonition to everyone to “get down to
work” and “do something” — which is, of course, damned ironic. The play
ends with Sonya’s invocation of the Kingdom to Come, a world kinder to
them than the present, one where they can finally rest. This oddly
unsatisfying ending seems as if Chekhov himself had tired of the whole
thing and decided to wrap it in a shroud and give it a quick Christian
burial. But there is much more going on here. I think Chekhov was
beginning to really hate the upper class that he had recently become a
part of.</p>
<p><em>Three Sisters</em> (1900) features many of the same conventions
and characters —drunken freeloading doctors and idle aristocrats
nibbling their caviar, drinking their vodka, and lusting after all the
wrong people. In this one, the three sisters live in the biggest, most
luxurious and (as it turns out) the only fireproof house in the
neighborhood. Their late father’s house is not only a cultural island in
a provincial backwater; it is also a meeting place for a tiny slice of
Russia’s vast pre-revolutionary bureaucracy and the military that holds
it together.</p>
<p>The plot is almost as convoluted as General Stanley McCrystal’s
Afghanistan pacification <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/29/mcchrystal-afghanistan-powerpoint-slide">PowerPoint</a>
— one featuring multiple love triangles, duels, gamblers, sick children,
alcoholics, yogurt, cuckolds, you name it. Expanding on the dreariness
of work so present in <em>Vanya</em>, <em>work</em> plays an important
part in <em>Sisters</em>. Brother Andrey is nothing like his man of
action father; he’s a chubby shlub with academic potential but he seems
happier working as a county bureaucrat. Andrey has a gambling habit, is
married to a woman of dubious taste and morals, and lives with sisters
Irina (who works at the telegraph office), Olga (at the board of
education), and Masha (who is married to a high school teacher and gym
coach).</p>
<p><em>Sisters</em> is a play about the decline of the aristocracy fully
underway. At one point Irina says, “You say life is so beautiful. But
suppose it isn’t? Look at us. Three sisters. Our life hasn’t been so
beautiful; it’s choking us up like a lawn full of weeds. […] We have to
work, we really do. The reason we’re unhappy and think life is so awful
is because we don’t know what it means to work. We come from families
who thought they never had to work…” Each is about to experience further
shocks in lives outside their own control.</p>
<p>But this ambitious play’s mechanics are so overly complicated that
Chekhov had to use extremely awkward exposition in multiple places to
lay out backstories and plot complications. In many of Chekhov’s plays
characters use the <em>aside</em> to make clear what they are thinking,
whereas a modern playwright would either <em>show</em> us or use more
oblique and artful dialog. And this has not aged well.</p>
<p>But what makes many of Chekhov’s plays, especially <em>Sisters</em>,
<em>most dated</em> and unlovable is what apparently made them so
lovable for British audiences at the start of the 20th century. Martin
Esslin has a chapter in Harold Bloom’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1417454.Anton_Chekhov">book</a>
on Chekhov in which he mentions that George Bernard Shaw may have been
the first to recognize the attraction that Chekhov’s plays held for the
English upper classes — for no other reason than both the Russian and
British aristocracies were crumbling and they knew it. According to
Esslin, Shaw — the socialist dandy — modeled his <em>Heartbreak
House</em> (1919) on Chekhov’s <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> (1903). By
the Twenties Chekhov’s plays were having great successes in London, and
throughout the Forties and Fifties British plays were increasingly
borrowing from Chekhov.</p>
<p>In the United States Tennessee Williams tapped into the same
insecurities, miseries, mental illness, alcoholism, and decline of the
Southern aristocracy. Like the Russian nobility now losing their
fortunes because they couldn’t extract free labor from their serfs, the
Southern planter class could no longer rely on free labor from slaves.
In Williams’ <em>Streetcar</em> Blanche DuBois has been widowed by her
husband’s suicide, has been <em>reduced</em> to teaching (before she is
fired for having a sexual relationship with one of her students) and she
wistfully and frequently recalls her family’s lost estate, <em>Belle
Reve</em>, the same “lovely dream” that Chekhov’s nobility cling to.
Like Olga, Irina, and Masha, Blanche is living with <em>her</em> sister
out of necessity. You can’t get much more Chekhovian than all of
this.</p>
<p>Esslin goes on to credit Chekhov with influencing whole generations
of modern playwrights and even taking “Chekhov’s technique of characters
in apparently idle and trivial chatter to its extreme” in absurdist
works like <em>Waiting for Godot</em>. Interestingly, the film version
of <em>Streetcar</em> featured Marlon Brando, who embraced the
<em>Stanislavsky method</em> — the same Stanislavsky who directed some
of Chekhov’s plays and most likely saved his playwriting career after
the disastrous premiere of <em>Seagull</em>. And Chekhov’s nephew
Michael, an actor, created a variant of the Stanislavsky method which he
taught in Germany and Hollywood.</p>
<p><em>The Cherry Orchard</em> (1903) is probably Chekhov’s best-known
play and one that resonates best with modern audiences. In it Chekhov
has again preserved all of the elements of then-popular farce and
vaudeville, but even clearer than in <em>Three Sisters</em> is the
uncluttered and indelible theme of the <em>Cherry Orchard</em>: The End
for the aristocracy. In the end the family’s vast estate with its
orchards are literally chopped down. And not just the end of aristocracy
but its unsuitability to continue to rule Russia along with the
simultaneously bright and terrifying prospects of a rising middle class
taking over the reins.</p>
<p><em>Cherry Orchard</em> was Chekhov’s last play and he maintained
until the end that it was a farce, not a tragedy. And how could it be a
tragedy when he had made it so plainly about Russia embarking on a new,
uncharted path? How could it be a tragedy when he painted his perpetual
student as the victim of the Czar’s prisons? How could it be a tragedy
when both the former owners of the orchard and its almost 90 year-old
former serf were clearly not going to survive in this brand new world?
Only the wheeler-dealer who ultimately buys the estate seems to have his
head screwed on properly — despite his obvious shortcomings in
education. But it’s not as if the man didn’t try to warn the estate
owners, who had frittered away their savings and lived in illusion.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Chekhov, who would be dead the following year,
<em>again</em> argued with the play’s director, Stanislavsky, about how
<em>Cherry Orchard</em> ought to be played. Although he reputedly sat in
during rehearsals Chekhov may have never seen the entire piece performed
as the tragedy that Stanislavsky insisted it was. Chekhov died the next
year in a German sanatorium where he had gone for treatment for his
tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Having read Chekhov’s plays several times, I still have not seen the
major ones performed. As Chekhov’s own experience with his work shows,
direction and interpretation are everything. I would like to see them on
stage some day and, short of this, do a desk read with friends and
discuss them.</p>
