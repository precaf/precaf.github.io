When Theodor Herzl published [Der Judenstaat](http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/der-judenstaat-1236/1) in 1896, anti-Semitism was the *raison d'etre* for a Jewish state. "Die Welt widerhallt vom Geschrei gegen die Juden, und das weckt den eingeschlummerten Gedanken auf." (The world resonates with screams against the Jews, and that wakes long-slumbering thoughts.)" 

Herzl had in mind either a Jewish state in what is now Argentina or in the "ever-memorable historic home" of Palestine, which was clearly his his preference. Herzl saw the poorest European Jews emigrating first to the new state — the most desperate, those of "mediocre intellects" who would do the rough work of establishing a foothold. They would then be followed later by "those of a higher grade." 

Herzl thought it would be necessary to entreat the Sultan [Turkish emperor] to give European Jews some of the land Turkey was then occupying. In exchange, Herzl daydreamed, Jews would get the Ottoman Empire's finances back in order. The new Jewish state would be neutral, form a bulwark against Asian "barbarism," and would be a Eurocentric state "in contact with all Europe, which would have to guarantee our existence." In exchange, the Jewish state would guard the extra-territorial sanctuaries of Christendom and Christians would be grateful to a people they once hated.

It may irk today's Zionists to hear Israel referred to as a "colonial enterprise," but this is precisely what Herzl imagined it to be in its infancy. Israel was to be created by two separate organizations — the Society of the Jews, and by the Jewish Company. Like the Hudson Bay Company which explored Canada, and the London Company, which founded the American colonies, Herzl's Jewish Company (later the Jewish National Fund, and later still national offshoots like the American and Canadian Jewish Federations) were set up to create a pipeline of colonists to a new land. The Jewish Company was to be based in London.

The chapter, "The Jewish Company," describes how the company acquires land and builds housing for its first wave of poor Russian and Romanian workmen. There would have to be inducements to work for their homes, to stay out of trouble — and the seven hour day was one such inducement. No man was to be idle, for development of a moral citizenry was one of Herzl's goals. A tenth of the citizenry was to be tasked with military defense. The Jewish Company would provide housing, set up bank accounts, provide loans, create employment by creating industries, purchase a family's assets when they emigrated, and help them as soon as they arrived in the Jewish state. What Herzl described was — without irony or exaggeration — a vast "colonial enterprise."

Herzl anticipated the use of indigenous, non-Jewish labor. This was the 19th Century, slavery was not an alien concept, and Herzl worried about the misuse of local slave labor instead of well-compensated seven-hour-a-day workers, which he regarded as a morally repugnant shortcut. The Jewish Company would, therefore, prevent the abuse and enslavement of non-Jewish labor by using boycotts (the irony!), roadblocks, or "various other methods." 

In "Local Groups: Our Transmigration," Herzl describes the process of resettlement. No one would have to migrate in steerage, though luxury travelers would have plenty of travel options. Each travel group would have a rabbi, who would be enlisted in the nation-building project. "Our rabbis, on whom we especially call, will devote their energies to the service of our idea, and will inspire the congregations by preaching it from the pulpit." The long history of Zionist co-optation of Judaism seems to begin with this.

The Middle Classes — and by such Herzl was not referring to sad-sack "mediocre intellects" from Russia and Romania, but German-speaking Austro-Hungarian elites of whom he was a member — would lead this new society. What Herzl described sounds very much like the world of English colonials in India: "The middle classes will involuntarily be drawn into the outgoing current, for their sons will be officials of the Society or employees of the Company 'over there.' Lawyers, doctors, technicians of every description, young business people — in fact, all Jews who are in search of opportunities, who now escape from oppression in their native country to earn a living in foreign lands — will assemble on a soil so full of fair promise. The daughters of the middle classes will marry these ambitious men. One of them will send for his wife or fiancee to come out to him, another for his parents, brothers and sisters. Members of a new civilization marry young. This will promote general morality and ensure sturdiness in the new generation; and thus we shall have no delicate offspring of late marriages, children of fathers who spent their strength in the struggle for life. Every middle-class emigrant will draw more of his kind after him. The bravest will naturally get the best out of the new world."

Herzl's theory of the state is simplistic. He rejects Rousseau's Social Contract out of hand, instead grasping at the Roman Empire's concept of "gestor" — advocate. The role of "gestor" is played by the Society of the Jews. "This organ of the national movement, the nature and functions of which we are at last dealing with, will, in fact, be created before everything else. Its formation is perfectly simple. It will take shape among those energetic Jews to whom I imparted my scheme in London." The "energetic Jews" Herzl was referring to were members of the Maccabean Club in London, with whom he met in 1895. 

In describing how the land would be occupied by the new settlers, Herzl writes, "In America the occupation of newly opened territory is set about in naive fashion. The settlers assemble on the frontier, and at the appointed time make a simultaneous and violent rush for their portions. We shall not proceed thus to the new land of the Jews." Herzl, the cultured Viennese idealist, would never have imagined today's hilltop settlers of the West Bank.

Herzl did not have a democracy in mind, nor would differences of opinion be permitted in the new state: "I incline to an aristocratic republic. This would satisfy the ambitious spirit in our people, which has now degenerated into petty vanity. Many of the institutions of Venice pass through my mind; but all that which caused the ruin of Venice must be carefully avoided. We shall learn from the historic mistakes of others, in the same way as we learn from our own; for we are a modern nation, and wish to be the most modern in the world. Our people, who are receiving the new country from the Society, will also thankfully accept the new constitution it offers them. Should any opposition manifest itself, the Society will suppress it. The Society cannot permit the exercise of its functions to be interpreted by short-sighted or ill-disposed individuals." It seems he got his wish.

Today the state that Herzl envisioned still operates without a constitution. Its borders remain in dispute. Its citizens argue whether they are Jews or Israelis. Israel has greater religious diversity than the United States owing to large Palestinian, Bedouin, and non-Jewish European groups. And a [million](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/07/05/the-million-missing-israelis/) of its citizens live abroad.
