*A review of "Consequence" by Eric Fair.*

I began this book last night and finished it this morning. Although the first person, present tense is grating for the length of an entire book, and Fair still is not fully open with himself or his readers, it was an engrossing read. My three stars reflects an average of four stars for interest yet only two for candor.

What happens to a man who goes off to war? The book certainly answers *this* question: nightmares, guilt, alcoholism, sometimes death -- either by war or the man's own hand. 

How does a man like this reconcile his own religion with what he is ordered to do? I don't think we ever really get an answer. In his account, Fair's family expect him to become a pastor like his grandfather, but he is drawn to a darker, physical side, first becoming a policeman, where he learns to deploy violence against people who are always (well, at least in theory) criminals. For the longest time Fair thinks religion will save him, and the book contains a strange account of his interrogation of salafis who tell him how much like *them* he really is -- a thread that really leads nowhere. Aside from Fair's restlessness and his perpetual life crises, readers never really learn why he avoids the ministry, why he stubbornly clung to Presbyterianism despite it changing in front of his eyes, why he *really* dropped out of theological school. It wasn't that his writing was starting to take off; it was something else, unnamed, unexamined.

And why does a man go off to war -- especially when many in his family have warned him against it? Fair again avoids fully answering the reader's questions, but we sense a tremendous restlessness in him that leads him to ignore his father's and grandmother's counsel. Fair is obviously a person of well above-average intelligence, and he is given to instrospection and guilt, but he shies away from truly probing the demons that still stir within him.

The book begins with a quote from Maimonides' *Laws of Repentance*. Maimonides was the Arab-Jewish Talmudist who, besides being the Sultan's physician, wrote *Guide for the Perplexed* and had much to say on moral conduct. Maimonides counsels the guilty party to approach his victim "again and again until he his forgiven." Islam requires precisely the same of a wrong-doer, while in Christianity a hall pass signed by Jesus suffices. Unfortunately, all of Fair's -- and Bush and Cheney's, and Obama's -- victims are now either dead or lost to squalid prisons in places where Americans will fear to go for a long, long time. A dark truth never acknowledged in this book is that there never will be apologies -- and there never will be forgiveness for these personal and national sins.

And so in the end Fair falls back on his Christianity -- or perhaps just wishful thinking. In his aunt's words, Eric Fair ends up forgiving himself: "I am just a human kid."
