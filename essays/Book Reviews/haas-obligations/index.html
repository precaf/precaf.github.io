<p><em>The Bill of Obligations: The Ten Habits of Good Citizens by
Richard N. Haas</em><br />
<em>ISBN: 9780525560654</em></p>
<p>For starters, it helps to know who Richard Haas really is. Read <a
target="_blank" href="https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/the-sun-sets-on-richard-n-haasss">this</a>.
Haas characterizes himself as apolitical but he is an ideological
dinosaur who was hatched in the Cold War and went on to support every
manner of US intervention, most notably in Iraq. His love of democracy,
if he really has one, certainly doesn’t extend beyond US borders. He
bemoans diminished US influence, wants to promote a type of democracy
that can stand up to Chinese intervention (even mockery) and be an
example for the world to emulate. Who says the United States should aim
to foist its own overripe democracy on the world? Haas goes on to talk
about how the executive branch has assumed war powers from Congress but
as a neoconservative he himself took full advantage of it</p>
<p>Haas writes, “Americans are required to observe the law, pay taxes,
serve on juries, and respond to a military draft, if there is one.“
Right. Just like Bone Spur Trump. Haas downplays the fact that the
rights of the highest and lowest in America are vastly different. Even
our obligations are different. Shouldn’t we fix this rather than making
appeals to citizenship and nostalgia? Haas provides numerous examples
that show how the Constitution is deformed and has led to virtually
every democratic crisis in our history, but despite his own knowledge of
all this, his book is about citizenship. Haas’s thesis is constructed by
completely rejecting the structural inequalities and defects in law and
society as primary threats to a healthy democracy. This is a sneaky
little book for Liberals who want to listen to MAGA bedtime stories.</p>
<p>Haas tells us that fixing voting rights, making election day a
holiday, making it easier to vote, eliminating barriers to voting,
regulating social media, getting rid of dark money in political
campaigns, offering open primaries, ending the filibuster, expanding the
court, eliminating income inequality, improving education, introducing
paid family leave, offering free college, student loan forgiveness, tax
reform, and immigration reform – none of these things are going to do
anything to fix our democracy. “This is where obligations come in:
American democracy will work, and reform will prove possible only if
obligations join rights at centerstage.“ This is exactly the same”pull
yourself up by your bootstrap, there is no racism in America” magical
bullshit that MAGA America loves to sip on. In reality, we need massive
structural reforms, if not a complete do-over, and <em>then</em> we can
talk about citizenship – within a completely new context.</p>
<p>Haas’s 10 obligations are intended to be uncontroversial, appeal to
patriotic emotion, and invoke an America of 50 years ago. But, given the
state of our democracy, and the fact that we are 2 minutes to midnight
before a new Fort Sumter, almost all of Haas’s prescriptions require
copious caveats and exceptions:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Be informed</em>: OK; (2) <em>Get involved</em>: Americans
waste a lot of time trying to get little single-focus groups to do
something when their political institutions should be leading the
charge. So get involved in what?; (3) <em>Stay open to compromise</em>:
Within reason, but what ever happened to sticking to your guns? The last
debt ceiling impasse revealed that Democrats’ idea of compromise was
rolling over and sacrificing Black people; (4) <em>Remain civil</em>:
Civility is vastly overrated. Civility is what liberals demand of those
who (rudely or not) speak justice to power; (5) <em>Reject
violence</em>: This is a strange appeal given that Haas’s necon buddies
killed a million people in Iraq. And if America ends up fascist, it will
be the obligation of every American to fight it; (6) <em>Value
norms</em>: We ought to question what the norms <em>are</em>. Racism and
American exceptionalism are norms and I don’t want any part of them; (7)
<em>Promote the common good</em>: Fine; (8) <em>Respect government
service</em>: This asks too much when the levers of government are
usually tilted against the poor, those of color, and non-citizens –
especially if those service employees are in the military, jails, border
patrol, or police or work in an unjust legal system; (9) <em>Support the
teaching of civics</em>: Not if the civics taught was concocted at
Hillsdale College or promotes flag-waving neoliberalism; (10) <em>Put
country first</em>: Why not an internationalist outlook?</p>
<p>This is a book that both Democratic Neoliberals and MAGA
Conservatives can read because, without either caring to admit it, they
share many of the same values.</p>
<p>If you’re considering buying this book, don’t.</p>
