As part of my ongoing theater self-education I read [The Theater and Its Double](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75867.The_Theater_and_Its_Double) by Antonin Artaud. When this was written Artaud was in and out of  psychiatric care. He was also waging battles in ink with detractors over concepts he had enunciated in various manifestos of the Theatre of  Cruelty. When a reader encounters this work for the first time (at least in translation) it is not clear that the translator knew what she was  doing — but it becomes clear that Artaud was simply on a different  wavelength from everyone else.

In launching his arguments Artaud  begins with a "what if?" What is man's true nature? How would he react,  say, to the end of the world or a massive plague? Artaud goes off on a  pseudo-scientific detour that almost frightens away the reader.  Elsewhere in this collection of manifestos, text, and polemics Artaud  conceives of a new manner of theater in which verbal language is  replaced with code, where actions and emotions are broken down into a  taxonomy of gestures. This is damned wild stuff and at least half of it  rings like the ravings of a lunatic ... which, arguably, he was at the  time of its publication.

With this said, however, the *Theater and Its Double* is an interesting read because of its dissection of theater's  persistent weaknesses. Naturalism, for one, which was just gaining  strength, clearly ticked off Artaud, who expected more of theater. For  Artaud, theater is a primal sphere, a holy sphere, filled with man's  greatest longings, his greatest hungers, his greatest fears. Mere  representation of social and psychological conflict was a trivialization of theater's potential. Artaud rails against the bourgeousification of  theater, its detachment from the wants and fears of the common man, and  its self-castration. And as a major voice of French Avant- garde  theater, he certainly made his case, although the common man has a low  threshold for lunacy and conceptual art. Still, many of Artaud's  criticisms of theater are spot-on even today.

But Artaud goes off on so many incoherent tangents that it's impossible for it all to fit  together. In concocting a new Occidental theater, Artaud drew from  Balinese theater, Tarot, the Kabbalah, astrology, and his own eclectic  pseudo-scientific theories.

Kimberly Jannarone's [Artaud and His Doubles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107321-artaud-and-his-doubles) looks at Artaud's place in theatre and finds "two sets of doubles: one, a body of peculiarly persistent received interpretations from the  American experimental theater and French post-structuralist readings of  the 1960s; and, two, a darker set of doubles brought to light through  close historical examination — those of Artaud's contemporaries who, in  the tumultuous, alienated, and pessimistic atmosphere enveloping much of Europe after World War I, denounced the degradation of civilization,  yearned for cosmic purification, and called for an ecstatic loss of the  self."

It wouldn't be too many years until Europe was "purified" of those accused of degrading civilization.
