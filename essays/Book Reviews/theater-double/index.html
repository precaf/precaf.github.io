<p>As part of educating myself about the theater, I read
<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75867.The_Theater_and_Its_Double'>The
Theater and Its Double</a> by Antonin Artaud. When he wrote it, Artaud
was in and out of psychiatric care. He was also waging battles in ink
with detractors over concepts he had enunciated in various manifestos of
the <em>Theatre of Cruelty</em>.</p>
<p>In launching his arguments Artaud began by asking: what is man’s true
nature? How would he react, say, to the end of the world or a massive
plague? Artaud goes off on a pseudo-scientific detour on plagues,
listing affected organs he believed accounted for human behavior.
Elsewhere in this drawer-full of manifestos, text, and polemics Artaud
conceives of a new manner of theater in which verbal language is
replaced with code, where actions and emotions are broken down into a
taxonomy of gestures.</p>
<p>With this said, however, the <em>Theater and Its Double</em> is an
interesting read because of its dissection of theater’s persistent and
all-too real weaknesses. Naturalism, for one, which was just gaining
strength, clearly ticked off Artaud, who expected more of theater. For
Artaud, theater is a primal sphere, a holy sphere, filled with man’s
greatest longings, his greatest hungers, his greatest fears. Mere
representation of social and psychological conflict was a trivialization
of theater’s potential. Artaud rails against the bourgeousification of
theater, its detachment from the wants and fears of the common man, and
its self-castration. And as a major voice of French Avant- garde
theater, he certainly made his case, although the common man has a low
threshold for lunacy and conceptual art. Still, many of Artaud’s
criticisms of theater are spot-on even today.</p>
<p>Even Chekhov, in <em>The Seagull</em>, predated Artaud’s criticisms
when he had Treplieff say, “When the curtain rises on that little
three-walled room, when those mighty geniuses, those high-priests of
art, show us people in the act of eating, drinking, loving, walking, and
wearing their coats, and attempt to extract a moral from their insipid
talk; when playwrights give us under a thousand different guises the
same, same, same old stuff, then I must needs run from it… If we can’t
[have a new theatre], let us rather not have it at all.”</p>
<p>But Artaud goes off on so many incoherent tangents that it’s
impossible for it all to fit together. In concocting his new Occidental
theater, Artaud drew from Balinese theater, Tarot, the Kabbalah,
astrology, and his own eclectic pseudo-scientific theories.</p>
<p>And, viewing them in a historical context, there was a dark side to
Artaud’s theories. Kimberly Jannarone’s
<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107321-artaud-and-his-doubles'>Artaud
and His Doubles</a> looks at Artaud’s place in theatre and finds “two
sets of doubles: one, a body of peculiarly persistent received
interpretations from the American experimental theater and French
post-structuralist readings of the 1960s; and, two, a darker set of
doubles brought to light through close historical examination — those of
Artaud’s contemporaries who, in the tumultuous, alienated, and
pessimistic atmosphere enveloping much of Europe after World War I,
denounced the degradation of civilization, yearned for cosmic
purification, and called for an ecstatic loss of the self.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be too many years until Europe was “purified” of those
accused of degrading civilization.</p>
