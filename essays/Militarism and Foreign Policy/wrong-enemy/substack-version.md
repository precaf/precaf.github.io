An authoritative critic of the American national security state is Andrew Bacevich, West Point Class of 1969, retired Army Colonel, and historian specializing in international relations, security studies, American foreign policy, and American diplomatic and military history. Bacevich is a Professor Emeritus of International Relations and History at Boston University.

[Bacevich's](https://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176680/tomgram%3A_andrew_bacevich%2C_america_terrorized/) essay in TomDispatch yesterday ("America Terrorized") makes the case that billions, and now trillions, of national treasure have been squandered annually since the 1950's fighting largely phantom enemies.

Even so, Americans today do not feel safe and, to a degree without precedent, they are being denied the exercise of basic everyday freedoms. Judged by this standard, the apparatus created to keep them safe and free has failed. In the face of a pandemic, nature's version of an act of true terror, that failure, the consequences of which Americans will suffer through for months to come, should be seen as definitive.
