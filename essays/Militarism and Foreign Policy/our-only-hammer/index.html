<p>This morning I read two different op-eds on ISIS. Dana Milbank ponders the proper way to talk about risks and “bad guys” to children, and Chace Howland regurgitates the old line that – just like Chamberlain with Hitler – the West has been too easy on ISIS: now is the time for allies to strike.</p>
<p>In other words – keep a stiff upper lip and attack the “bad guys” anew.</p>
<p>The problem is – there’s nothing new in any of this. Worse, it shows just how narrow our thinking has become on issues of foreign policy. When you have a monstrous military, every foreign policy choice involves “defense” – no need to ponder one’s own responsibility for creating the conflict. There’s only one hammer in our tool belt, and it’s a bomb.</p>
<p>We’ve been at war in the Middle East almost as long as my children, now pushing thirty, have been alive. A whole generation has grown up in perpetual war, never knowing full civil liberties, seeing the decline of infrastructure, education, health, and security by the middle and working classes. The only constant during all this time has been our addiction to war.</p>
<p>Chace Howland sees parallels between Germany of the Thirties and ISIS. The Nazis had an ideology; so does ISIS. Check. The Nazis wanted to expand their territory; so does ISIS. Check. Ergo: they’re the same. His is a rather shallow analysis for a history teacher. Nazism was a reaction to the failures of liberal democracy in a once-advanced, highly educated and cultured nation, and was characterized by scapegoating within that democracy. In many ways, the United States is a better candidate for Nazi analogies than ISIS. We have military bases in 150+ countries. The Patriot Act has gutted most of our Bill of Rights – something that white people have only recently lost but which minorities have never completely enjoyed. And we now have presidential candidates who want to slap yellow stars on our citizens.</p>
<p>Yes, ISIS is powerful, but only relatively so. Its power comes from all the failed states in the Middle East that the United States and its “allies” have created. If ISIS appears strong in Iraq it is because George Bush’s and Paul Bremer’s “de-Baathification” policy destroyed the Iraqi military. If ISIS is strong in Libya, thank Obama and Clinton. If ISIS is strong in Syria, thank John Kerry. And thank all the American presidents of both parties that encouraged, funded, and armed religious militias during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The United States created Islamic extremism. Both Republicans and Democrats have blood on their hands. And we still seem determined to finish off Assad’s Syria. This is insanity.</p>
<p>We claim to be shocked at the horrific beheadings and religious repression of “apostates” by ISIS. And yet our great friend Saudi Arabia is about to stage a mass execution of a variety of “criminals,” including a well-known poet who renounced Islam and a teenager who attended a pro-democracy demonstration with his uncle. Sounds like ISIS to me. If Mr. Chace thinks the ideology behind ISIS will be exterminated by allied bombing, he is mistaken. Saudi Arabia’s Wahhabist oil peddlers are beloved by both Bushes and Clintons.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the heart of things – the Middle East is a Middle Eastern problem. Even if we bomb Raqqa and Tikrit and Mosul into powder, terrorism is not going away. We flatter ourselves to think that the US and Russia are in a “proxy war” in the Middle East – one that could be resolved by finding a nice chateau for Syria’s Assad to live out his days in. But the balance between democracy, religion – and of what kind? Western, Sunni or Shiite? – is at the heart of all this. Saudis want their own democracy, not a family-owned kleptocracy; Egyptians want their own form of democracy instead of a military junta: but the United States continues to support these repressive regimes. Kurds want their own state; religious minorities want protection from majorities. Some of the messes of colonial meddling with borders need to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>Drones and F16’s will fix none of this.</p>
<p>We like to think of ourselves – not as the world’s policeman – but as a force for good in the world. Yet we are neither. Our policing of the world has been as violent and mercurial and damaging as it is at home. As a for being a force for good, this is more wishful thinking. We will never know what it is to be a good friend and neighbor until we have learned to count every one of our own citizens as such.</p>
