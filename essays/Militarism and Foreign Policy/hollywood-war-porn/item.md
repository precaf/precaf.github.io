Al Jazeera has a series called [Empire](http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/general/2009/01/200912116355722575.html) hosted by Marwan Bishara. Recently Bishara did a segment on Hollywood called "Hollywood and the war machine" which took an unflattering look at how &#8212; long before the American press began "embedding" with the military &#8212; sleeping with the Pentagon was Standard Operating Procedure in Hollywood. Bishara interviewed outsiders Oliver Stone, Michael Moore, and Christopher Hitchens for his segment. Although the United States has lost almost every war following World War II, Hollywood (with incredible Pentagon meddling) nevertheless projects an image of the military as an unstoppable victor. How can this be?

At one point in the video Michael Moore describes American war movies as "war porn." A spot-on characterization of a nation that rarely succeeds in its conquests but still likes to fantasize that it can still get it up with anyone of its choosing.
