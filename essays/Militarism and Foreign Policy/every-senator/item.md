_I sent a version of this letter to every US Senator shortly before the Invasion of Iraq_



October 8, 2002

Dear Sen. xxx:

I am writing you to convey my opposition to President Bush's plan to attack Iraq.

This war, if you and other members of Congress let it happen, will be fought for all the wrong reasons -- not the least of which is its use as a distraction to our domestic economic problems.

I urge you to listen to the significant number of Americans who oppose this proposed action; to our friends in Europe, Asia, and virtually every other nation on earth; and to the United Nations, which for many years was a partner rather than an enemy. Very few people in the world believe this war is necessary, and the Administration has not yet offered a convincing argument.

The United States can be strong without becoming a belligerent nation. Rather than rejecting negotiation and pursuing unilateralism, it is time for this Administration to be jerked back into line, back into reality, and to be forced to listen - rather than trying to dictate - to what the American people want.

Please do not let the Bush Administration have _ carte blanche_ to pursue this stupid and dangerous war. Remember the legacy of the Viet Nam War and the decades-long impact it had on the U.S.

Regards,
