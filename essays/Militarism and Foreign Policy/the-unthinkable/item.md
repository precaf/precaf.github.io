While foreign policy junkies were busy parsing Jeffrey [Goldberg's overhyped article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-point-of-no-return/8186) in the Atlantic on Israel's likely future attack on Iran, [another article in the same issue](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/living-with-a-nuclear-iran/8193) of the Atlantic by Robert D. Kaplan attempted to repurpose one of Henry Kissinger's old Cold War theories for use with Iran - specifically, that the only way to deal with upstart revolutionary nations like Iran is to be willing to engage with them in limited nuclear war. Kaplan writes:

> We must be more willing, not only to accept the prospect of limited war but, as Kissinger does in his book of a half century ago, to accept the prospect of a limited nuclear war between states.

What is he saying? That, should Goldberg's wet dream not come true and that Iran does get the bomb, the United States should be willing to use its own against it - regardless of preemptive use or massive civilian casualties. Kaplan reflects a little on the implications, but seems pretty happy with the war criminal's approach anyway:

> At the time of his writing _Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy_, some analysts took Kissinger to task for what one reviewer called "wishful thinking"- in particular, his insufficient consideration of civilian casualties in a limited nuclear exchange. Moreover, Kissinger himself later moved away from his advocacy of a NATO strategy that relied on short-range, tactical nuclear weapons to counterbalance the might of the Soviet Union's conventional forces. (The doctrinal willingness to suffer millions of West German civilian casualties to repel a Soviet attack seemed a poor way to demonstrate the American commitment to the security and freedom of its allies.) But that does not diminish the utility of Kissinger's thinking the unthinkable.

This analysis is typical of Kaplan. In 2005 he tried to sell the same stinking Kissinger fish, [this time for war with China](http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/062005_kaplan_clamor.shtml). 

Couldn't the Atlantic have hired two writers with different views for these bookended articles? More to the point: couldn't the Atlantic have hired a couple of real Iran experts? And couldn't the Atlantic have hired a couple of writers who personally had NOT served in the Israeli army? 

Kaplan, a stealth neocon armed with only a BA from UConn, seems to have the ear of ostensible Liberals. Unfortunately, his influence is all out of proportion to his scholarship or the quality of the goods he's selling. [Tom Bissell's blistering review of Kaplan's career](http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/summer/bissell-euphoria-perrier/) and work shines light not only Kaplan's errors of judgment - but that shown by those who peddle Kaplan's work.
