<p>As I wrote in a <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/christian-nationalism">previous</a>
post, many of the ideological battles we are having today were conceived
in the war of words between abolitionists and apologists for the
“peculiar institution” of slavery which raged in the decades before the
outbreak of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Though they may be centuries apart, Republicans today share not only
a similar world view but routinely employ polemics strangely similar to
those of antebellum apologists for slavery.</p>
<p>Take, at random this <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gop.gov/bidens-supreme-court-nominee-is-a-leftist-activist-that-should-not-be-confirmed/">Republican
Party assessment</a> of now-confirmed Supreme Court Judge Ketanji Brown
Jackson: “she will act as a Far-Left activist judge and a rubber stamp
for Biden’s woke agenda if confirmed.”</p>
<p>If anything, this sounds more like typical snark from right-wing
members of Congress. But if you dive a little deeper into the choice of
words it’s not just McCarthyite or Bircher vocabulary that the GOP is
using. It’s a way of communicating a certain world view.</p>
<p>Whether Ketanji Brown Jackson grew up a red diaper baby devouring the
works of Marx and Lenin (which she didn’t) or began her career as a
corporate lawyer (which she did) is immaterial. When Republicans say
“far-left” Liberals hear the word and want to confront its literal
meaning. When Evangelicals hear the word they know it’s code for
“un-Christian.” Likewise, when Republicans use the words “woke” or
“activist” they also know that Evangelicals will infer certain meanings
from them.</p>
<p>The fact is, anyone to the left of Marjorie Taylor Green and her
Proud Boyfriends is considered “far-left” (ie., infidel, atheist,
socialist, communist) by today’s Republicans. And nobody in their right
mind would deny that Republicans themselves are effective activists. But
as the GOP increasingly adopts white Christian Nationalist language,
their rhetoric increasingly mirrors arguments and phrases found in
pro-slavery apologetics. One of the most often-cited examples of the
latter is James Henley Thornwell’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://ia600203.us.archive.org/3/items/rightsdutiesofma00thor/rightsdutiesofma00thor.pdf">sermon</a>
entitled “The Rights and Duties of Masters.”</p>
<p>Thornwell was a South Carolina Presbyterian minister, slave owner,
and prolific slavery apologist. Disgusted with smug abolitionists
calling slavery immoral, on May 26, 1850 he preached “The Rights and
Duties of Masters” at the dedication of a church for slaves. Thornwell
prefaced his remarks with a line from Colossians IV:1. <em>Masters, give
unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also
have a Master in heaven.</em> He was reminding each member of the
audience, Black and white, that the Confederate social order had been
ordained by God.</p>
<p>Thornwell began by accusing abolitionists of “woke” hypocrisy and
persecution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The slave-holding States of this confederacy [this was 11 years
before the Confederacy was actually created] have been placed under the
ban of the publick opinion of the civilized world. The philanthropy of
Christendom seems to have concentrated its sympathies upon us. We have
been denounced with every epithet of vituperation and abuse, as
conspirators against the dignity of man — traitors to our race, and
rebels against God. Overlooking, with a rare expansion of benevolence,
the evils which press around their own doors, the vices and crimes of
their own neighbors and countrymen…</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he accused the abolitionists of creating “divisiveness” and
insurrection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This insane fury of philanthropy has not been content with
speculating upon our degradation and wretchedness at a distance. It has
aimed at stirring up insurrection in our midst.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thornwell implied that a smug little group of abolitionists actually
presented an existential threat to the Confederate order established by
God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A spurious charity for a comparatively small class in the
community, is dictating the subversion of the cherished institutions of
our father, and the hopes of the human race — the utter ruin of this
vast imperial Republick, is to be achieved as a trophy to the progress
of human development.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he slammed Northern and European “liberal” values for the
excesses of “unchecked democracy” and mad secular social scientist
tinkerers. In fact, you can practically hear Thornwell railing against
the “lawless” Black Lives Matter movement and its allies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The agitations which are convulsing the kingdoms of Europe — the
mad speculations of philosophers — the excesses of unchecked democracy,
are working out some of the most difficult problems of political and
social science; and when the tumult shall have subsided and reason
resumed her ascendancy, it will be found that the very principles upon
which we have been accustomed to justify Southern slavery, are the
principles of regulated liberty — that in defending this institution we
have really been upholding the civil interests of mankind — resisting
alike the social anarchy of licentiousness — that we have been
supporting representative, republican government against the despotism
of masses on the one hand, and the supremacy of a single will on the
other.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignoring the issue of slavery, Thornwell instead portrayed the
conflict between Northern and Southern modernities as a “clash of
civilizations.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But that the world is now the theatre of an extraordinary
conflict of great principles — that the foundations of society are about
to be explored to their depths — and the sources of social and political
prosperity laid bare; that the questions in dispute involve all this is
dear and precious to man on earth — the most superficial observer cannot
fail to perceive.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Thornwell named names of his enemies — leftists and atheists —
again offering “regulated freedom” as the alternative. Thornwell
predates right-wing critics of Critical Race Theory who object to an
“oppressor-victim” dynamic and deplore secular tinkering with the order
God has created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The parties in this conflict are not merely Abolitionists and
Slaveholders; they are Atheists, Socialists, Communists, Red
Republicans, Jacobins on the one side, and the friends of order and
regulated freedom on the other. In one word, the world is the battle
ground, Christianity and Atheism the combatants, and the progress of
humanity the stake. One party seems to regard society, with all its
complicated interests, its divisions and subdivisions, as the machinery
of man, which, as it has been invented and arranged by his ingenuity and
skill, may be taken to pieces, reconstructed, altered or repaired, as
experience shall indicate defects or confusion in the original plan. The
other party beholds in it the ordinance of God; and contemplates ‘this
little scene of human life’ as placed in the middle of a scheme, whose
beginnings must be traced to the unfathomable depths of the past, and
whose development and completion must be sought in the still more
unfathomable depths of the future – a scheme, as Butler expresses it,
‘not fixed, but progressive, in every way incomprehensible;’ in which,
consequently, irregularity is the confession of our ignorance, disorder
the proof of our blindness, and with which it is as awful temerity to
tamper as to sport with the name of God.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Confederate world any threat to the established order (one
with plantation owners at the top, white sharecroppers in the middle,
and slaves a the bottom) was an abomination. For Thornwell, any sort of
“activist” was an enemy of “order and regulated freedom” — and that
included not only Communists and Jacobins but “red” Republicans (the
Mitt Romneys and Susan Collinses of their day).</p>
<p>The remainder of Thornwell’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://ia600203.us.archive.org/3/items/rightsdutiesofma00thor/rightsdutiesofma00thor.pdf">long
sermon</a> is well worth reading. Highlights include: denying that
slavery is the physical ownership of a person; that only a slave’s labor
is property; that Paul of the Gospels was less concerned with slavery
than a slave’s reverence toward his master, a reverence that reflects
God’s order; that, far from denying a slave his humanity, slavery makes
him an equal partner in God’s plan; … and the like. The sermon is so
long, in fact, that Thornwell seems to have employed every pro-slavery
argument he could think of and, in the process, made it a perfect
exemplar for future study.</p>
<p>Because of its growing economic and political isolation, and because
of the need to defend slavery from liberal criticism, the South slowly
developed an alternative view of modernity that turned its back on
liberal values that were at least given lip service in Europe and the
North. And while one may be tempted to conflate the “Lost Cause” with
slavery alone, the “Lost Cause” <em>was</em> the South’s alternative
modernity, one that featured agrarian Capitalism based on chattel (not
wage) slavery, “regulated freedom” (a high and very selective level of
repression), a rigid hierarchical social order, a highly porous
separation of church and state, and an ideologically and racially
homogeneous citizenry.</p>
<p>Southern Christianity was also diverging from the North’s. For
preachers and other apologists of slavery, their sermons increasingly
focused exclusively on the life of the spirit rather than the temporal
lives of slavers and their “property.” Working for social justice or
calling for change to social structures defied the Southern social order
established by God (in actuality the C.S.A.) and was therefore
“un-Christian.”</p>
<p>Anthea <a target="_blank" href="https://antheabutler.com/">Butler</a> points out in
“White Evangelical Racism” that many of these world views still exist in
white American Evangelism — including in some cases the refusal to
condemn slavery. One such apologist is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSKj3LQilcI">John MacArthur</a>,
pastor of the Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California. While
acknowledging the horrors of <em>Roman</em> slavery, MacArthur paints a
rosy picture of <em>biblical</em> slavery and refuses to condemn the
Southern Christian version, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gty.org/library/bibleqnas-library/BQ010813/what-is-scriptures-view-of-slavery">explaining</a>
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>New Testament teaching does not focus on reforming and re
structuring human systems, which are never the root cause of human
problems. The issue is always the heart of man—which when wicked will
corrupt the best of systems and when righteous will improve the worst.
If men’s sinful hearts are not changed, they will find ways to oppress
others regardless of whether or not there is actual slavery. On the
other hand, Spirit-filled believers will have just and harmonious
relationships with each other, no matter what system they live under.
Man’s basic problems and needs are not political, social, or economic
but spiritual ….</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Emancipation and well into the present day, this same religious
justification continues to be used to wave away state and collective
responsibility for current or historical racist oppression. The same
religious justification has more recently become a convenient rationale
for banning even the <em>mention</em> of racist systems of oppression or
teaching about them. While we may be irked to hear Critical Race Theory
reviled as a leftist plot, what is really jaw-dropping is to understand
that, for Evangelicals, racism does not actually exist in society but
instead exists only in the heart.</p>
<p>Using another pro-slavery argument based on the Southern Christian
slave / master / God power structure, MacArthur reduces slavery to
simply working for a living:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Throughout history, including in our own day, working people have
been oppressed and abused by economic intimidation that amounts to
virtual slavery—regardless of the particular economic, social, or
political system.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For MacArthur resisting the oppression of slavery is “un-Christian”
because it violates the power structure. Seen from the same perspective,
<em>any</em> opposition to oppression must therefore be
“un-Christian”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nowhere in Scripture is rebellion or revolution justified in
order to gain freedom, opportunity, or economic, social, or political
rights. The emphasis is rather on the responsibility of slaves to serve
their human masters faithfully and fully, in order to reflect the
transforming power of God in their lives. […] In his letter to the
church at Ephesus, Paul wrote unambiguously, “Slaves, be obedient to
those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and
trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; not by way of
eye service, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart” (<a
target="_blank" href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Eph.%206.5–6">Eph.
6:5–6</a>).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that MacArthur uses precisely the same citation from Paul of the
Gospels that Thornwell did in 1850. Note also that the Evangelical
rejection of injustice in the real world is completely at odds with most
of Judaism, mainstream Christianity, Catholic Liberation Theology, and
the Black Church. In other words, for all their talk about so-called
“Judeo-Christian” values, they don’t actually share critical
understanding with Jews and other Christians.</p>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge that while <em>some</em> Evangelicals
are white Christian Nationalists, not <em>all</em> are. A perfect
illustration is the bitter fight that erupted within the Campus Crusade
for Christ (now called “Cru”) when that organization recognized it had a
racism problem and brought in diversity trainers. As you might imagine,
the <a
target="_blank" href="https://languagendreligion.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/seeking-clarity-and-unity.pdf">Christian
Nationalists</a> within Cru pushed back. Similarly, there are currently
two different battles going on within the Southern Baptist Conference:
one about <a
target="_blank" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/critical-race-theory-divides-the-southern-baptist-convention.html">Critical
Race Theory</a> and another about the <a
target="_blank" href="https://protestia.com/2022/04/02/conservatives-urge-boycott-of-disneyland-during-sbc-convention-after-discounted-tickets-offered/">Disney
Corporation</a>. And SBC nationalists use the same <a
target="_blank" href="https://capstonereport.com/2022/04/11/as-the-sbc-elites-go-woke-members-become-more-conservative/37914/">insulting
rhetoric</a> against their religious brethren that they use on their
outside enemies.</p>
<p>The 179-page <a
target="_blank" href="https://languagendreligion.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/seeking-clarity-and-unity.pdf">document</a>
that the SBC nationalists created provides an excellent overview of what
white Christian Nationalists believe about subjects as far-ranging as
the role of the church, social justice, race, sexuality, gender issues,
and Critical Race Theory. It also contains well-organized tables listing
think tanks and individuals who manufacture objections to Critical Race
Theory, and each of their talking points.</p>

least within the Evangelical world — <a
