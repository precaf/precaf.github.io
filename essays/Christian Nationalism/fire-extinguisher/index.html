<p>The Democratic Party is the only thing standing in the way of the
Republican Party replacing America with a Christian theocracy.</p>
<p>And that is an absolutely terrifying thought.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/opinion/beware-the-ruinous-optimism-of-democratic-leaders.html">geriatric</a>
Democratic Party leadership — faced with an ongoing Republican coup, a
Christian nationalist Supreme Court, dramatic assaults on civil
liberties and separation of church and state, a war in Ukraine, energy
price spikes, galloping inflation, the possibility of a recession, and
more mutations of the COVID virus — well, they’ve certainly had their
hands full.</p>
<p>But they’re fighting a national five-alarm fire with a home
extinguisher.</p>
<p>Rather than leveraging the tools of a government still in power,
Democrats have refused to enforce party discipline on Democratic Senate
free agents like Joe Manchin or Krysten Sinema, abolish the filibuster,
<em>prosecute</em> January 6th insurrectionists, expand the Supreme
Court, or employ the considerable powers of the Presidency to preserve
what’s left of American democracy. There is no presumptive Democratic
candidate for President in 2024 and no apparent plan to replace the many
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/opinion/beware-the-ruinous-optimism-of-democratic-leaders.html">geezers</a>
in Democratic House and Senate leadership roles.</p>
<p>There’s also no way Joe Biden can run <em>and</em> win the next
presidential election. GOP hostility is a <em>given</em>, but many
Democrats are worried that Biden &amp; Co. are not up to the many
challenges and disasters facing the country. Biden would be 82 if he
actually began a second term as President. But who wants him? Not GOP
voters, and not engaged progressive Democrats.</p>
<p>Merely competent, Biden has exhibited few of the leadership skills
necessary to pull the country back from The Abyss. He is not a
reassuring presence, as FDR or even Jimmy Carter were. His public
addresses have been few and far between and he and the Democratic Party
he leads have backtracked on almost every progressive promise ever
made.</p>
<p>Right down the line — canceling student debt, expanding Medicare,
enacting police reform, bolstering voting rights, shrinking the Pentagon
budget — the Democratic House may have put on legislative dinner
theater, but the Senate has done little to advance these bills. Is Chuck
Schumer <em>really</em> less gifted than Mitch McConnell? Or is there
simply a lack of will when it comes to full-throated support for
Democratic policies like racial equity and abortion rights? — values
once regarded as mainstream but now apparently too “far left” for some
Democrats. A 2019 article in <em>The Atlantic</em> by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/progressivism-making-democrats/586372/">Peter
Wehner</a> enumerates many of the fears of these Democrats who have
internalized <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/07/22/are-progressives-taking-over-the-democratic-party/">conservative
claims</a> that “self-styled progressives” from the “Far Left” are
“taking over” the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>But that’s nonsense, say progressive Democrats. NY Representative
Alexandria <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1520108070151536641">Ocasio-Cortez</a>
fires back on the “Far Left” label with: “The extreme left is taking
over WHERE. In Texas, Republicans passed a law allowing rapists to sue
their victims for getting an abortion. Can anyone name a ‘far left’
policy <em>that</em> extreme implemented <em>anywhere</em>? We can’t
even get our party to import cheaper RXs from Canada.”</p>
<p>Ocasio-Cortez’s complaint raises the bigger issue that you can’t get
Democrats to take strong action on even wildly popular issues. Take the
worst of recent Democratic losses — abortion. Democrats lost abortion
because they didn’t try hard enough to keep it.</p>
<p>For years Democrats refused to formalize abortion rights into law.
Asked if his administration would fight for the Freedom of Choice Act —
which he had promised to do as a <em>candidate</em> — <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/2009/04/obama-freedom-of-choice-act-not-highest-legislative-priority/">President
Obama</a> told CNN senior White House correspondent Ed Henry that it “is
not the highest legislative priority.” Hillary Clinton’s 2016 running
mate was a long-time <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/07/hillary-clinton-picks-anti-abortion-tim-kaine-for-vice-president.html">foe
of abortion</a>. Nancy Pelosi famously <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-course-you-can-be-democrat-against-abortion-n749856">argued</a>
that “of course” you can be [both] a Democrat and against abortion.</p>
<p>Like Obama, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/us/politics/joe-biden-abortion-2006.html">younger
Biden</a> also refused to support abortion rights. “I do not view
abortion as a choice and a right. I think it’s always a tragedy,” Biden
was quoted in a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qNRZ6WVkZI">videotaped
interview</a> with Texas Monthly. “I think it should be rare and safe
[…] I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of
abortions.”</p>
<p>Even after the leak of the draft overturning <em>Roe v Wade</em>, the
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jim-clyburn-henry-cuellar-democrats-abortion-1348005/">Democratic
Party went out of its way</a> to undermine pro-choice Democrat Jessica
Cisneros in a primary contest with Henry Cuellar, an anti-abortion
Democrat being currently investigated in an illegal scheme with
Azerbaijani energy interests.</p>
<p>There’s no denying that budgets are expressions of priorities. While
there never seems to be much money for the social safety net, expanding
healthcare, subsidizing education, making vaccines available to poorer
nations, or providing debt relief for our own students, <em>somehow</em>
Democrats managed to scrounge together <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.vox.com/23125706/ukraine-aid-russia-invasion-us-40-billion">an
extra $53 billion</a> lying around the house to give to defense
contractors for the Ukraine war. And the war is just getting
started.</p>
<p>This is <em>in addition to</em> the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-house-passes-bill-boosting-bidens-record-defense-budget-2022-07-14/">record</a>
$800 billion Pentagon budget passed by a three-to-one majority by the
Democrat-controlled House. Representative Andy Levin, a member of the
Progressive Caucus, expressed his dismay: “On the whole, the National
Defense Authorization Act exemplifies the basic fact that we spend far
too much on military-first solutions and far too little on diplomacy and
on human needs at home and around the globe.”</p>
<p>Even our foreign policy under a Democratic President has not departed
considerably from that of the Trump administration. While Trump (and
Bush before him) may have glimpsed a soul in Vladimir Putin’s eyes,
Biden is no slouch when it comes to sucking up to autocrats and
repressive regimes.</p>
<p>Biden’s recent hat-in-hand trip to the Middle East was an
embarrassment. Instead of penalizing Israel for killing
American-Palestinian journalist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.state.gov/on-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh/">Shireen
Abu Akleh</a>, Biden gave it an extra billion dollars in military aid
and agreed to restrict the rights of Americans who support <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/14/the-jerusalem-u-s-israel-strategic-partnership-joint-declaration/">boycotts</a>
against Israel’s Apartheid-style occupation of the West Bank. And by the
time he got to Saudi Arabia, rather than sanctioning the Saudi regime
for the gruesome murder of Washington Post reporter <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62186332">Jamal
Khashoggi</a>, Biden allowed himself to be lectured by Khashoggi’s
killer in order to extract Saudi concessions to produce more oil.</p>
<p>If Democrats think that they can run Biden or continue to limp along
with leaders like Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer, and Clyburn, they are
mistaken. Yet we are sure to hear that “now is not the time” to let a
new crew steer the ship of state. Some new iteration of an uninspiring
“Better Deal” or “Build Back Better” campaign will be unloaded on voters
and we will be reminded how <em>competently</em> Democratic
septuagenarians and octogenarians saved the economy from calamity and
kept thousands from dying of COVID.</p>
<p>And they’re not totally wrong. But what American voters want is not
mere competence but <em>boldness</em>. And here’s why.</p>
<p>The fact is, no one has much faith that American democracy as it now
exists can survive with perpetual gridlock, such intense political
divides, endless conflicts between state and federal courts and law, and
ongoing assaults on people of color and sexual minorities. To this,
throw in the fact that no solution to this stalemate is possible under
our deeply flawed, deeply destabilizing, and deeply anti-democratic
Constitution.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a Constitutional crisis not so much because
one party figured out how to sabotage it but because the Constitution
itself is such a mess. Until this document is shredded and re-written,
we can have no political stability.</p>
<p>And this is precisely <em>why</em> American voters are always seeking
bold change instead of unexciting competence. Like it or not, setting
fire to the country <em>does</em> constitute bold change. If Democrats
want to compete, then, where are <em>their</em> bold ideas? Purposely
thrown overboard as “too far left.”</p>
<p>I fear that the potential of the idealized “America” which most of us
grew up with and truly love will be gone in a few years — permanently
disfigured by Christian nationalists and abandoned by those who couldn’t
bring themselves to fight harder to hold onto it.</p>
