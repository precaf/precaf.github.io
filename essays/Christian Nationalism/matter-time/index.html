<p>It was just a matter of time before religious zealots and culture
warriors came for the books in SouthCoast school libraries.</p>
<p>Last Spring Dartmouth had a <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/maga-candidate">MAGA school
committee candidate</a> who wanted to ban books. Recently, Fall River,
Tri-Town (Rochester, Marion, Mattapoisett) and Little Compton, Rhode
Island, all had run-ins with religious extremists, most of them
sponsored by local Republican town committees.</p>
<p><a
target="_blank" href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">PEN
America</a>, an association that fights for freedom of expression for
writers, issued a timely report titled “Banned In the USA: The Growing
Movement to Censor Books in Schools.” PEN has identified over 50 groups
involved in censorship campaigns – a number of them listed as hate
groups, including <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.massresistance.org/AboutUs.html">MassResistance</a> –
a bunch of haters from Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>
<h4 id="fall-river"><strong>Fall River</strong></h4>
<p>In Fall River, a group called the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.tfp.org/">American Society for the Defense of
Tradition, Family, and Property</a> launched a “Rosary Rally” in Fall
River:</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>On October 24th the “TFP” brought its “Rosary Rally” from Crazytown
to Fall River. The group has a long list of policies and people they
hate, thinks its antics constitute “spiritual warfare” and defends <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.tfp.org/the-european-discovery-and-settlement-of-the-new-world-is-based-on-the-right-of-conquest/">colonialism
and forced conversion</a> based on the “Right of Conquest.” The Southern
Poverty Law Center has been watching this group of crackpots for a while
and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/10/07/extremists-many-stripes-gather-values-voter-summit-2011">had
this to say</a> about them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Maybe the weirdest bunch in were from the American Society for
Tradition, Family and Property (TFP), a self-described Catholic
organization whose representatives seemed to be wearing red cloaks. The
TFP table had a particularly noxious pamphlet – ‘10 Reasons Why
Homosexual ‘Marriage’ is Harmful and Must be Opposed’ – that argued that
same-sex marriage ‘ignores a child’s best interests’ and that it ‘turns
a moral wrong into a Civil Right.’ The pamphlet blamed same-sex marriage
for forcing Christians to ‘betray their consciences by condoning … an
attack on the natural order.’ Another TFP pamphlet warned hysterically
about the dangers of ‘socialism,’ which, for some unknown reason, given
our hyper-capitalist economy, they seem to think is on the march and
targeting ‘traditional marriage’ and ‘parental rights.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="little-compton"><strong>Little Compton</strong></h4>
<p>In Little Compton, Rhode Island, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://upriseri.com/little-compton-taxpayers-association-releases-homophobic-q-anon-inspired-campaign-mailer/">Little
Compton Taxpayer’s Association</a>, essentially a proxy for the GOP,
sent out a homophobic, Q-Anon inspired campaign mailer asking recipients
to vote a straight Republican (what else?) ticket.</p>
<p><img src="mailer.png" /></p>
<h4 id="tri-town-marion-mattapoisett-rochester"><strong>Tri-Town
(Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester)</strong></h4>
<p>In the Tri-Town area at least two School Committee members are
Christian nationalist MAGA supporters flogging “anti-CRT” nonsense and
shouting at maximum volume, “They’re indoctrinating our children!”</p>
<p>Old Rochester school committee member Joe Pires and Rochester school
committee member Anne Fernandes are also anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers,
anti-CRT, anti-gay, and (of course) anti-diversity. Posts from both deny
that racism exists anywhere than in the hearts of nasty people.
Apparently, the moment that Abraham Lincoln liberated slaves, all of
America’s race problems simply disappeared magically.</p>
<p>Both of these idiots are up for re-election next year.</p>
<p>Recently, Pires <a
target="_blank" href="https://wbsm.com/old-rochester-regional-library-sexually-explicit-books/">condemned</a>
LGBTQ+ books at ORR as “pornographic.” From one side of his mouth Pires
claimed to oppose banning books. But from the other he was still calling
for, well, <em>banning books</em>:</p>
<p><img src="banning.png" /></p>
<p>Pires reposted a Hillsdale College livestream. As <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.salon.com/2022/03/15/how-this-tiny-christian-college-is-driving-the-rights-nationwide-against-public-schools/">Kathryn
Joyce</a> pointed out in Salon magazine, Hillsdale is the sharp end of
the assault on public schools by Christian Nationalists.</p>
<p><img src="hillsdale.png" /></p>
<p>In coordinating his attack on district school libraries, Pires
managed to violate Open Meeting laws by coordinating the attack with
fellow committee member Anne Fernandes, a kindred spirit, on a Facebook
group Pires founded called “Tri-Town Buzz.”</p>
<p>I located three of Pires’ Facebook accounts (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JoePiresORRSC/">this</a> and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1865623920344562/user/1422655257">this</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/joe.gpb">this</a>) and two of
Fernandes’ (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1865623920344562/user/100003614575364">this</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/anne.fernandes.562">this</a>).
Fernandes seems to spend a fair amount of her time promoting <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.churchfinder.com/churches/ma/middleboro/meetinghouse-church">an
Evangelical church</a> as well as many of the groups that PEN identifies
as censorship organizations.</p>
<p>Pires is bad enough, but Fernandes is a real piece of work. In
addition to her <a
target="_blank" href="https://precaf.github.io/links/Fernandes.zip">hate-filled
posts</a> about gay children and parents, Fernandes ignorantly dispenses
conspiracy theories and just plain bad science. There are numerous
examples of Facebook flagging her posts with the polite equivalent of
“BS!”</p>
<p><img src="warning.png" /></p>
<p>Fernandes is just the sort of creature that Republicans love, which
is why the Mattapoisett Republicans sponsored her talk at the local
library:</p>
<p><img src="republicans.jpg" /></p>
<p>At that October 27th presentation organized by the Mattapoisett
Republicans, Fernandes worked from <a
target="_blank" href="https://precaf.github.io/links/what-learning.pdf">PowerPoint
slides</a>, claiming that librarians are indoctrinating children with
“CRT” instead of history and passing themselves off as sex education
teachers (she’s confusing them with teachers). And for an “expert” with
22 years of teaching, Fernandes seems completely clueless that LGBTQ+
kids are at risk and that books that represent them help.</p>
<p><img src="what-discussing.png" /></p>
<p>For all her swearing up and down that she doesn’t believe in book
banning — here are the books Fernandes wants to ban:</p>
<p><img src="the-books.png" /></p>
<p>Efforts like Fernandes’ are part of a wider Republican campaign to
gut public schools. In Arizona, gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake (who
is trailing Katie Hobbs with 79% of the vote counted) promised to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.alternet.org/2022/11/kari-lake-2658593938/">scale back
education</a> on science, math, and history. North Carolina’s Christian
Nationalist Lt. Governor, Mark Robinson, wants to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.witn.com/2022/08/23/memoir-lt-gov-mark-robinson-calls-taking-science-history-out-elementary-schools/">ban
science and history</a> outright in elementary schools.</p>
<p>If science shines light on contagion and vaccination, and history
sheds light on social ills that still plague us, it’s pretty clear what
Christian Nationalists think of both. <a
target="_blank" href="https://prismreports.org/2022/11/07/florida-adds-more-homophobic-censorship-laws-to-dont-say-gay-suite-of-bills/">State
legislation</a>, especially in the South, has literally made it a crime
to speak of sexual identity or racism in schools.</p>
<p><a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/11/ron-desantis-moms-for-liberty-florida-book-bans.html">Moms
for Liberty</a>, one of the most vocal and fast-growing groups of
Christian Nationalists attacking school districts, has teamed up with
so-called “Constitutional Sheriffs” to investigate alleged
“indoctrination” of children in the schools. The Claremont Institute, a
MAGA think tank, is now offering <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.claremont.org/page/sheriffs-fellowship/">Sheriff’s
Fellowships</a> to facilitate more <a
target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/09/claremont-institute-secret-sheriff-fellowship-curriculum-revealed.html">muscular
takeovers</a> or compliance of school boards.</p>
<p>The right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), known
for its dangerous legislation, is now targeting local school races. Its
spin-off, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2022/11/04/new-documents-show-alec-targeting-school-board-and-other-local-races/">American
City and County Exchange</a> (ACCE), is now coordinating efforts with
the GOP, Moms for Liberty, the Heritage Foundation, the DeVos family,
and others to recruit and run candidates to take over local school
boards.</p>
<p>The next right-wing school committee candidate your local Republican
town committee sponsors will be amply funded and likely supported by not
only locals but ACCE.</p>
<h4 id="community-members-fight-back"><strong>Community members fight
back</strong></h4>
<p>One group fighting back is <a
target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/tri-town-against-racism/home_1">Tri-Town
Against Racism</a>. In response to the attempted book bans at ORR, TTAR
circulated a <a
target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQnJnjM4RaB44F3UdsrXsQae1GvCpcuIEHt8eBuenhwRCGLw/viewform">petition</a>
which described the harms to children:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Attempts to ban books highlighting underrepresented kids sends them
the message: You shouldn’t exist; your story doesn’t matter and we don’t
want our kids to empathize with you. This is a dangerous message which
can result in grave consequences, like depression, self-harm and
suicidal ideation. No child should feel like they are unworthy and
undeserving of love and respect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petition received tremendous support in the community, was signed
by 631 people, and was presented to the superintendent — who apparently
listened.</p>
<p>In a <a
target="_blank" href="https://newbedfordlight.org/opinion-banning-books-sends-the-wrong-message-to-marginalized-students/">powerful
letter</a> to the New Bedford Light, Mattapoisett resident Nicole
Demakis explained in more detail why access to books that conservatives
find offensive is critically important to LGBTQIA kids:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I believe it is imperative that we allow kids to have access to
literature in our schools which represents a broad spectrum of
experiences for those who may be struggling with identity, whether that
be children of color, gay, straight, bi, asexual or transgender. It may
be an uncomfortable truth for those who don’t understand other’s
experiences growing up facing prejudice, confused about their feelings,
being bullied, made fun of or excluded because that child does not
understand who they are. Not to be cliché, but no one knows another’s
reality until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes; and to discount that
reality further by stigmatizing literature that may speak to them, but
not you, is wrong. As an example of this, studies show that LGBTQIA
youth are not inherently prone to suicide risk <em>because</em> of their
sexual orientation or gender identity. Rather, they are placed at a
higher risk <em>because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in
society.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To raise the level of public debate on this issue, TTAR is holding
the third of a series of Community Conversations on November 14th. You
can <a

up here</a>.</p>
<p>In Fall River, United Against Hate is holding a similar <em>Community
Conversation About the Recent Rise in the South Coast of Book Banning,
Drag Queen Story Time Protests And Hate Speech</em> on November 16th.
Contact <a target="_blank" href="https://unfr.org/contact-us/">United Neighbors of Fall
River</a> for a Zoom link.</p>
<p>In Rhode Island, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.eastbayri.com/stories/love-wins-rallies-in-response-to-little-compton-mailer,107994">Love
Wins Coastal</a> responded to the LCTA’s homophobic mailing with a rally
in the Town Commons. One Democratic Rhode Island legislator, on her own
initiative, joined in solidarity.</p>
<h4 id="democratic-party-needs-to-start-fighting"><strong>Democratic
Party needs to start fighting</strong></h4>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, all these efforts by kind and caring
people, including exemplary legislators acting independently, are still
not enough. They are no match for the think tanks, the laboratories of
repressive legislation, the rapidly spreading extremism, and the
Republican Party itself.</p>
<p>Equality, diversity, education, race, history, libraries, free
speech, and respect and acknowledgement of differences. These are
today’s battlefields for Republicans.</p>
<p>It’s high time that local Democrats started fighting alongside the
brave and lonely defenders who have been waging the Democratic Party’s
battles for them.</p>
