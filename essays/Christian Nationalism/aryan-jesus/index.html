<p>Today’s culture wars are being fought by supposed followers of Jesus.
But the version of Jesus they revere is not the man of miracles and
multitudes who showed compassion for a woman about to be stoned to
death. For Christian Nationalists the canonical Jesus is a lamentable
“woke” sissy who would turn the other cheek, look for the best in
people, oppose exploitation, and feed the hungry. As for that adulterous
woman he pitied, they’d stone her to death in a second if the hangman’s
rope were not the preferred tool of their vigilantism.</p>
<p>Instead, the version of Jesus that Christian Nationalists prefer is
the vengeful killer from <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-13.html">Revelations
19:13</a>, riding in on a war horse, robe dripping with blood, eyes
blazing with fury, sword slashing, bronze boots stomping to death anyone
who ever got in his way.</p>
<p><a
target="_blank" href="https://politicalresearch.org/2021/04/20/white-evangelical-racism">Anthea
Butler</a>, theologian, professor, and author of <em>“White Evangelical
Racism</em>,” described in an interview with Political Research
Associates how Evangelicals became politicized by religious crusades
starting in the Forties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As early as the 1940s, Billy Graham had fused Christianity with
patriotism and White supremacy. His goal was to make believers—including
Black and Brown folks who had started to listen to him—conform to White,
male, Western Christian ideals. He demonized Communists, Catholics, and
immigrants. Interestingly, he got support from William Randolph Hearst’s
<em>Los Angeles Examiner,</em> which gave these ideas added prominence.
[…] American exceptionalism—the idea that the U.S. is blessed by God—as
well as Christian patriotism were used by Billy Graham, the Rev. Bob
Jones, and other White male religious leaders of the mid-20th Century to
put parameters around what it meant to be an American and a Christian.
It does lead directly to MAGA.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a 2021 the centrist Christian magazine <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/quick-to-listen/christian-nationalism-capitol-riots-trump-podcast.html">Christianity
Today</a> (CT) published <em>Christian Nationalism is Worse than You
Think</em>. Written one week after the MAGA coup attempt, CT interviewed
Paul D. Miller, a professor of international affairs at Georgetown
University, who contrasted Christian Nationalism with Christianity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s easiest to define Christian nationalism by contrasting it with
Christianity. Christianity is a religion. It’s a set of beliefs about
ultimate things: most importantly, about the life, death, and
resurrection of Jesus Christ. It’s drawn from the Bible, from the Nicene
Creed, and the Apostles’ Creed. [] Christian nationalism is a political
ideology about American identity. It is a set of policy prescriptions
for what the nationalists believe the American government should do.
It’s not drawn from the Bible. It draws political theory from secular
philosophy and their own version of history as well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the “Worse than you think” part Miller discussed happens to be
<em>fascism</em>.</p>
<p>Samuel L. Perry and Andrew L. Whitehead are co-authors of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52509088-taking-america-back-for-god">book</a>,
<em>Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United
States</em>. In the run-up to the 2020 election, writing in <a
target="_blank" href="https://religioninpublic.blog/2020/02/05/christian-nationalism-talks-religion-but-walks-fascism/">Religion
in Public</a>, the two observed that “Christian Nationalism Talks
Religion, But Walks Fascism.”</p>
<p>Perry and Whitehead frequently, and correctly, place “Christian” and
“Christianity” in quotes because Christian Nationalism “represents more
of an ethno-cultural and political identity that denotes a specific
constellation of religious affiliation (evangelical Protestant),
cultural values (conservative), race (white), and nationality
(American-born citizen)” than religious orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Working from the definition of fascism in Jason Stanley’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38255329-how-fascism-works">How
Fascism Works</a>, there are obvious similarities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“an ideology built on reference to a mythic past; populist support
for strongman demagogues; a culture of anti-intellectualism, including
anti-education and anti-science beliefs; an ideology that views social
hierarchies as normal and necessary; idealization of patriarchal
families; peace maintained by authoritarian “law &amp; order” tactics;
strongly pro-nativist/anti-pluralism; foments cultural anxiety about
sexual deviance; and pervasive victim mentality.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a piece titled <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/06/05/beware-of-authoritarian-christians/">Beware
of Authoritarian Christians</a> New England United Methodist minister
Rev. William Alberts highlights the authoritarian dynamics within
Christian Nationalism. Much of the racism, sexism, and homophobia in
authoritarian “Christianity” indeed have roots in scripture, both Old
and New Testament. While churches have always been free to highlight the
good and ignore the bad in their own traditions and scripture, sometimes
they just pivot from bad to bad. But this is done for political
purpose.</p>
<p>Albert quotes Civil Rights leader Gilbert Caldwell, who explains how
Christian Nationalists pivoted from racism to homophobia: “White
traditionalists in 1972 realized they could no longer use the Bible to
justify the segregation of blacks in the ‘new’ UMC. Thus same-gender
loving persons and their ‘practice of homosexuality’ provided them the
opportunity to continue to discriminate, not because of race but because
of sexual orientation.”</p>
<p>In all of this, love and Jesus are missing, Alberts says, replaced by
Christian Nationalists’ insistence on authority, doctrine, discipline,
obedience, and literal interpretation. In contrast, Alberts cites the
loving Jesus in John 13:35 who expresses the essence of normative
Christianity: “By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if
you love one another.”</p>
<p>Russell Moore, former evangelical and editor in chief of Christianity
Today, told <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/08/1192663920/southern-baptist-convention-donald-trump-christianity">NPR</a>
that a number of evangelical pastors have told him that when they’ve
quoted Jesus in the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em>, with its reference to
“turning the other cheek,” congregants would come up to them and ask,
“Where did you get those liberal talking points?” When the pastor
replied, “I’m literally quoting Jesus Christ,” the response was, “Yes,
but that doesn’t work anymore. That’s weak.”</p>
<p>What those “followers of Jesus” prefer is the vengeful warrior from
Revelations. The one who <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/11/donald-trump-indictment-threat-jan-6/">promises</a>,
“If you go after me, I’m coming after you.” The one who <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/04/ron-desantis-slitting-throats-federal-jobs-president-campaign">promises</a>
to “start slitting throats” the day he’s inaugurated. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Romans-12-19/">Romans
12:19</a> says, “avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Lord.”</p>
<p><img src="crucifix.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Trump the Redeemer</em></p>
<p>While normative Christianity teaches that vengeance is the Lord’s,
Christian Nationalists had no problem hearing Trump <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/05/i-am-your-retribution-trump-rules-supreme-at-cpac-as-he-relaunches-bid-for-white-house">telling</a>
<em>his</em> Believers, “In 2016, I declared: I am your voice. Today, I
add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been
wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.” It’s no surprise that many
Trump supporters actually believe Trump is the messiah (see <a
target="_blank" href="https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/donald-trump-is-the-messiah/">this</a>
and <a

<p>In 2019 Christianity Today published an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html">editorial</a>
entitled “Trump Should be Removed from Office.” It argued that Trump’s
actions were illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral; that his Twitter
feed was a “near perfect example” of a human being “morally lost and
confused.”</p>
<p><em>Greater Boston</em> interviewed Evangelicals to get their take on
the editorial. Andrew Beckwith of the Christian Nationalist
Massachusetts Family Institute was unconcerned about Trump’s crimes or
immorality. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=886BxZDiiLo">Beckwith’s view</a>
was that as long as Trump delivered to the 200 Evangelicals he
mentioned, it was all for the greater good. His criterion was abortion,
saying evangelicals had to weigh Trump’s three ex-wives against 60
million “murdered children.” Beckwith ended his Trump apologetics by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=886BxZDiiLo&amp;t=622s">quipping</a>
that MFI was above partisan politics, even democracy, saying that “Jesus
was a monarchist” who was the “King of Kings, Lord of Lords.” As if
authoritarianism were Jesus-approved.</p>
<p>But Beckwith isn’t the only proto-fascist to be less interested in
the “Prince of Peace” than the “Lord of Lords.”</p>
<p>In the Thirties it occurred to Germany’s National Socialist regime
that, besides Jews, Jewish books needed to be destroyed. You can find
countless archive photos of book burnings that show the scope of the
Nazi destruction. Poetry, art, philosophy, history, and literature books
were all consigned to the flames if they had a Jewish author.</p>
<p>But then it occurred to the National Socialists that the book most
“Jewish” of all was The Bible. In 1939 the Institute for the Study and
Eradication of Jewish Influence on German Church Life (<em>Institut zur
Erforschung und Beseitigung des jüdischen Einflusses auf das deutsche
kirchliche Leben</em>) was founded, with symbolic purpose, in Eisenach,
where Luther (that other notorious anti-semite) translated the Bible
into <em>Hochdeutsch</em>.</p>
<p>The goal of the Institute was to produce a Bible that no longer
contained the Old Testament or any of the “Jewish” elements in the New
Testament. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.academia.edu/37948925/Susannah_Heschel_Reading_Jesus_as_a_Nazi_in_Tod_Linafelt_ed_A_Shadow_of_Glory_Reading_the_New_Testament_after_the_Holocaust_New_York_Routledge_2002_27_41">Susannah
Heschel</a>, a Jewish scholar at Dartmouth College, wrote a fascinating
account of this in “Reading Jesus as a Nazi” and expanded her research
into a book, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5650269-the-aryan-jesus">The
Aryan Jesus</a>. The Nazi Institute with the ambitious goal of
de-Judaizing the Bible produced two documents: one was a replacement for
the New Testament, <a
target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/die-botschaft-gottes">Die Botschaft
Gottes</a> (The Message of God). The other was a catechism called <a
target="_blank" href="https://elk-wue.gbv.de/data/1734793929/1734793929.pdf">Deutsche
mit Gott</a> (Germans with God) which was distributed widely to soldiers
during the war.</p>
<p>This presented the dilemma of what to do about the very popular
<em>Ten Commandments</em>, which had been given to a Jewish guy on a
mountain top and which had a whole dramatic backstory involving the arc
of poorly-behaved Jews becoming worthy of receiving the Law.</p>
<p><img src="twelve.png" /></p>
<p><em>The Nazi “Twelve Commandments”</em></p>
<p>A replacement would just have to do. Where the Torah offered butter,
<em>Deutsche mit Gott</em> offered margarine. Because Moses and his
tablets were <em>streng verboten</em>, the revisionist catechism offered
its own set of replacement <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thefreelibrary.com/HITLER&#39;S+12+COMMANDMENTS%3B+Nazi+Bible+says+&#39;Honour+Adolf&#39;.-a0149181182">commandments</a>
– twelve in number: <em>(1) Honour God and believe in him
wholeheartedly; (2) Seek out the peace of God; (3) Avoid all hypocrisy;
(4) Holy is your health and life; (5) Holy is your wellbeing and honour;
(6) Holy is your truth and fidelity; (7) Honour your father and mother -
your children are your aid and your example; (8) Keep the blood pure and
your honour holy; (9) Maintain and multiply the heritage of your
forefathers; (10) Be ready to help and forgive; (11) Honour your Führer
and master; (12) Joyously serve the people with work and
sacrifice.</em></p>
<p>Like its American cousin, German Christian Nationalism polluted
religious teachings with virulent nationalism. Section 7 of <em>Deutsche
mit Gott</em> is called <em>Gottes Vorsehung in der Geschichte der
Völker</em> (God’s Providence in the History of Nations) and is so
cringeworthy that a translation is in order (mine): “According to the
eternal plan, God directs the history of the races, nations and man in
their rise and fall. He decrees tasks and awakens strength through
leaders and masters. God has given us Germans the <em>Reich</em> as a
sacred mission. In the course of history, base thoughts, wild passions
and destructive powers oppose divine rule. Through all these threats,
God leads us to his goals and creates his eternal <em>Reich</em>.”</p>
<p><img src="section-7.png" /></p>
<p><em>Religion in the service of nationalist ideology</em></p>
<p>This may very well be <em>National Socialism</em> speaking, but
similar verbiage and sentiment is found in the “sacred mission” of
American exceptionalism, Manifest Destiny, the Puritans’ “City on a
Hill,” Zionism, Hindutva, Chinese Han nationalism, and in every colonial
empire throughout history that sought to bring its “god-given” values to
weaker, “inferior” “shithole” nations, which would elevate humanity
through conquest and genocide.</p>
<p>The <em>Botschaft</em> was of course stripped of the Old Testament,
but Christian scholars have noticed how, particularly, the Sermon on the
Mount was rewritten to make Jesus less an effeminate woke wimp and more
the bloody warrior. A review of Heschel’s book <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/the-aryan-jesus">The Aryan Jesus</a>
by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/hitler’s-gospel">John
Connelly</a> in the Catholic <em>Commonweal</em> magazine summarizes the
revisions to Jesus 2.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By contrast, when the “German Christians” got to work de-Judaizing
Christianity, they found Scripture so full of positive references to
Judaism that they had to rewrite it. In 1940 Grundmann and his
associates published their own, bowdlerized version of the Bible, called
<em>The Message of God</em> (<em>Die Botschaft Gottes</em>). Missing
from it were the Old Testament, John’s Gospel, and all references to
Jesus as servant or lamb of God. The institute argued that supposedly
original understandings of Christ as warrior had predominated “in a lost
original Gospel whose message had been distorted.” Thus the Sermon on
the Mount appeared, but with no blessing for the merciful. In the hands
of Grundmann and his colleagues, Christian teaching was warped to fit
Nazi obsessions: the need to meet hatred with hatred; the virtues of
manliness; and above all, the dark powers of the Jews to subvert the
German people. Where Paul was a solution for anti-Nazis, as a Jew he was
a problem for Christian racists, who argued that he “distorted” an
originally Hellenic Christianity. In 1942 Grundmann proclaimed that “a
German faith cannot be based upon Paul, because it would be deformed by
his Jewish system of coordinates.” Two years later a Thuringian pastor
called for removing Paul altogether in order to focus faith upon Jesus,
who had gone to death “in battle against Judaism.” The hierarchy
rejected these calls—fearing that such radical revisions would bolster
the arguments of those who said that German Christians were not really
Christian—and postponed them until some future time after the war had
been won.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasis on “Christian soldiers” is reflected in the
<em>Botschaft</em>. One page is particularly illustrative.</p>
<p><img src="sein-kampf.png" /></p>
<p>Section 5 is titled <em>Sein Kampf</em> (his fight, which you would
not be wrong to assume invokes <em>Mein Kampf</em>). The first lines are
taken from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-21.html">Mark
2:21-23</a>, widely interpreted as Christianity replacing Judaism. The
reader summary in the right column (“new and old are incompatible”)
makes that plain. The text reads (my translation): “Jesus spoke: No one
sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise the patch
tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. And
no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine will burst
the skins and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins.” The Nazi
censors omitted the last verse: “But new wine is for fresh wineskins.”
Understandable, since against their own advice they were putting new
wine in old wineskins.</p>
<p>This is followed by a verse from <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-chapter-10.html">Matthew
10:34-36</a>, where Jesus has gathered his disciples to say goodbye.
This Jesus is not the Prince of Peace but the Lord of vengeance (my
translation): “Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the
earth? I have not come to bring peace, rather the sword. I have come to
call man to account, even against his father. And even members of his
own household will become enemies to man.” Here the Nazi editors
censored Jesus: “For I am come to raise up man against his own father
and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law.” This might have been too much for the Third Reich’s
<em>family values</em>.</p>
<p>If you think American Christian Nationalism would never go to such
extreme lengths – rewriting scripture to distort the message of a
religion of love – think again. Long before the Nazis did it, as Anthea
Butler shows us, Southern Christianity transformed Christianity from a
religion of peace into a religion of master, slave, punishment and
obedience. Slavery’s leading apologists were predominantly
clergymen.</p>
<p>Today a vast army of self-appointed “prophets,” “intercessors,”
preachers, influencers, talking heads, “patriots,” and megachurch
pastors reshape, distort, censor, edit, and transform Christianity into
an unrecognizable goulash of hate and authoritarianism. Political power
is their god, and “sincere religious belief” is a convenient
Constitutional shield for systematically creating a theocracy from the
corpse of Jeffersonian democracy.</p>
<p>For the moment this extremist minority has the wind in their sails
and the Supreme Court in their pocket. I hope what’s left of our
democracy will survive their assaults.</p>
