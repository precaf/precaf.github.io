<p>In Massachusetts a major player in the well-financed assault on
secular institutions, public health, diversity, and science is the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/">Massachusetts Family Institute</a>
(MFI), a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.christiancentury.org/article/features/quiet-rise-christian-dominionism">Christian

target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/p/welcome-to-massachusetts-informed">Massachusetts
Informed Parents</a> (MIP), is involved in various skirmishes in the <a
target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/">Culture War</a>.</p>
<p>In a 2022 interview on <a
target="_blank" href="https://rumble.com/v1eysiz-red-pill-politics-cfn-with-michael-king-of-mass-family-institute.html">Red
Pill Politics</a>, MFI’s Director of Community Alliances Michael King,
described MFI as a local affiliate of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/">Focus on the Family</a> (FOF),
a fundamentalist Christian organization created by <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dobson">James Dobson</a>. FOF
has affiliates like MFI in <a
target="_blank" href="https://politicalresearch.org/2013/06/24/profiles-right-jim-daly">32
states</a> and in 2018 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/focus-on-the-family-has-declared-itself-a-church-avoiding-irs-disclosure-rules/">declared
itself</a> a church. MFI is a member of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://familypolicyalliance.com/">Family Policy Alliance</a>,
Focus on the Family’s national network of conservative Christian-right
state groups.</p>
<p>MFI’s astroturf group <em>Massachusetts Informed Parents</em> was
originally a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/691040948079576/">Facebook</a>
group but now functions as a separate entity with its own <a
target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/">Substack</a> blog. MIP
offers Christian conservatives a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MIP-Action-Item-List.pdf">checklist</a>
for attacking schools and libraries and maintains a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MIP-Parent-Advisory-Book-List-.pdf">book
banning list</a>. MIP/MFI is categorically opposed to sex education in
schools and advocates not education but counsels <a
target="_blank" href="https://weascend.org/">abstinence</a>. When MFI is not counseling
parents to <a
target="_blank" href="https://dailycitizen.focusonthefamily.com/ideas-for-homeschooling-your-children-from-massachusetts-family-institute-and-focus-on-the-family/">homeschool</a>
their children, they are laser-focused on turning public schools into
mirrors of the private Christian academies they send their children
to.</p>
<p>MFI, working closely with the right-wing legal groups Alliance
Defending Freedom, First Liberty Institute, and the New Civil Liberties
Alliance, has won some well-fought victories by intimidating municipal
government officials. However, when it throws its considerable weight
behind ballot initiatives it has not always had the same success in
convincing Massachusetts voters that they need more religion in their
schools, bedrooms or legal system.</p>
<p>This disparity in success may explain the far-right’s, and in
particular the GOP’s, focus on municipal elections. It’s much easier to
make political gains when town governments, who are barely able to pay
the bills thanks to tax limits like Proposition 2 ½, often have to make
the tough call that fighting religious bigotry is just too
expensive.</p>

<p>Besides Beckwith, MFI’s staff attorney <a

<p>ADF attorneys have argued a number of cases before the Supreme Court,
including cases about religion in public schools, the Affordable Care
Act, the legalization of same-sex marriage, business owners’ right to
not provide services for same-sex marriages, and prayers before town
meetings. ADF lawyers wrote the model for Mississippi’s anti-abortion
legislation involved in <a
target="_blank" href="https://adflegal.org/case/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization">Dobbs
v. Jackson</a> Women’s Health Organization, the decision that overruled
the fifty-year-old precedent case Roe v. Wade establishing the right to
abortion. ADF was also responsible for the recent <a
target="_blank" href="https://adflegal.org/case/303-creative-v-elenis">303 Creative v.
Elenis</a> case, which legalized religious bigotry against LGBTQ+
citizens. ADF was also involved in a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2023/06/05/documents-reveal-adf-requested-anti-trans-research-american-college-pediatricians">scheme</a>
with the discredited <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-college-pediatricians">American
College of Pediatricians</a> to use anti-LGBTQ+ “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-college-pediatricians">junk
science</a>” to “substantiate” many of ADF’s anti-LGBTQ+ talking points
and provide “medical” justification for interpreting Title IX to exclude
gender-identity protections for trans students in several states.</p>
<p>Besides ADF, MFI frequently works with <a
target="_blank" href="https://firstliberty.org/">First Liberty Institute</a>, a group
that works to insert Christianity into government. The First Liberty
Institute argued the <em>Kennedy v Bremerton</em> <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/kennedy_v._bremerton_(2022)">case</a>
before a friendly <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-418_i425.pdf">Supreme
Court</a>, a case in which a football coach coerced his teenage players
to pray with him at the 50 yard line. MFI also works with the <a
target="_blank" href="https://nclalegal.org/">New Civil Liberties Alliance</a> (NCLA), a
group which <a
target="_blank" href="https://ballotpedia.org/New_Civil_Liberties_Alliance">opposes</a>
student debt forgiveness, the existence of the CFPB, protections for
renters, and regulation of bump-stocks. MFI supports the interests of
and is <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/New_Civil_Liberties_Alliance">supported
by</a> deep pocket right-wing foundations like the Charles G. Koch
Foundation, the Searle Freedom Trust, the Bradley Foundation, and dozens
more. MFI has also partnered with <a
target="_blank" href="https://childparentrights.org/in-the-news/">Child and Parent
Rights</a>, another <a
target="_blank" href="https://childparentrights.org/legal-representation/">legal attack
group</a> that “defends parents’ right to secure their children against
the social contagion and harms caused by gender identity ideology,
providing legal representation before administrative agencies and state
and federal courts.”</p>
<h4 id="opposing-abortion"><strong>Opposing abortion</strong></h4>
<p>Though the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, which once made
abortion legal throughout the U.S., the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth
Amendment</a> to the Constitution still provides that “the powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it
to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the
people.” Following the Dobbs ruling states rushed to pass laws to
protect abortion, and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-abortion#supreme-court-ruling-">Massachusetts</a>
has a bunch of them. In 2020 when a budget amendment with an abortion <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Analysis-and-Text-of-New-Infanticide-Act-Nov-10-202018728.pdf">amendment</a>
in it came up for a vote, MFI labelled it the “Infanticide Act.”</p>
<p>And though the Christian right has had to accept the laws of the
Commonwealth, it has still found creative ways to subvert them. Besides
calling for bans of books that mention abortion, curriculum mentioning
it, creating fake abortion clinics that prevent women from receiving
<em>actual</em> medical care, or cheering the ban on the interstate
shipment of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/04/07/mifepristone-ruling-texas-washington-massachusetts">mifepristone</a>,
the MFI is also trying to reframe their own opposition to abortion as
“feminism.”</p>
<p>In 2022 MFI’s Andrew Beckwith joined with others from the Christian
right to “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anti-abortion-activists-massachusetts-trying-to-modernize-pro-life-movement-2022-8">modernize</a>”
the “pro-life” movement. CNN’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/08/19/boston-anti-abortion-advocates-reeve-pkg-lead-vpx.cnn">Elle
Reeve</a> visited MFI and spoke with MFI supporters trying pass off
anti-abortion as “feminism.” According to this narrative,
“consequence-free sex” places the burden of pregnancy on women and
“we’ve really let men off the hook.” Therefore, regardless of what the
pregnant woman herself wants, the man involved in the pregnancy must be
forced to accept its consequences by banning abortion. Even as MFI
supports a MAGA Republican agenda committed to slashing the social
safety net, its faux feminists argue for a system where women give up
individual liberties in exchange for expanding the social safety net,
for example by bolstering programs and laws like parental leave.</p>
<p>Men are the real victims here, characterized by Beckwith as
<em>devalued</em> by society. But MFI believes there is nothing more
ennobling to men than marriage. Unmarried yet sexually active men ought
to be forced into marriage by abortion bans, Beckwith says, “We believe
men should be responsible and be fathers and not use abortion as a kind
of after-the-fact contraception or get-out-of-jail-free card.” He says
that banning abortion will make men more responsible as fathers and will
“<em>restore the culture</em> to where fatherhood is valued and [will]
give them something better than just video games and Netflix.” Reeve
then asks Beckwith to clarify his ideological goulash: “I just don’t see
why I have to give something up so that men can be better people. […]
What if you made policy to address the <em>man problem</em> that
[actually] <em>addressed</em> the <em>man problem</em> directly?” To
this Beckwith had no answer, so it was up to the Christian ladies
interviewed to try to explain.</p>
<h4 id="defending-fake-abortion-clinics"><strong>Defending Fake Abortion
Clinics</strong></h4>
<p>Fake Abortion Clinics, sometimes called “crisis pregnancy centers”
(CPCs), operate in more than 30 locations in the Commonwealth. They
mislead patients about abortion and are not held to patient
confidentiality standards because they are not actually medical clinics.
One in New Bedford is literally on Catholic church property. According
to the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/files/advocacy/cpc-issue-brief.pdf">American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, 71% of crisis pregnancy
centers “use deceptive means such as spreading thoroughly debunked
misinformation” and 38% fail to disclose on their websites that they do
not provide abortion care.</p>
<p>In 2021 Connecticut <a
target="_blank" href="https://ctmirror.org/2021/05/05/ct-senate-advances-bill-banning-deceptive-advertising-by-faith-based-pregnancy-centers/">passed</a>
a law regulating CPCs. The state was then <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.courant.com/2021/10/13/a-new-connecticut-law-preventing-deceptive-advertising-at-crisis-pregnancy-centers-violates-the-first-amendment-lawsuit-alleges/">sued</a>
by lawyers from the ADF, MFI’s sister organization. In January ADF and
the state attorney general agreed to Connecticut’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253418/connecticut-crisis-pregnancy-center-drops-lawsuit-against-states-deceptive-advertising-ban">stipulation</a>
it would not enforce the law, thus dismissing the suit. MFI is now
attempting the same in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In July 2022 Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-warns-patients-about-crisis-pregnancy-centers">warned
patients</a> to be careful when seeking reproductive health care. “While
crisis pregnancy centers claim to offer reproductive healthcare
services, their goal is to prevent people from accessing abortion and
contraception,” Healey wrote. “In Massachusetts, you have the right to a
safe and legal abortion. We want to ensure that patients can protect
themselves from deceptive and coercive tactics when seeking the care
they need.” Healey had also warned Abundant Hope Pregnancy Resource
Center in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exhibits-1-2.pdf">Attleboro</a>
that the center could be held accountable for violating people’s civil
rights by “interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the exercise of
the constitutionally protected right to access abortion care in
Massachusetts.” The fake clinics were <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2022/09/massachusetts-crisis-pregnancy-centers-push-back-against-ag-maura-healys-consumer-advisory.html">incensed</a>.</p>
<p>MFI’s Beckwith, partnering with the <a
target="_blank" href="https://firstliberty.org/news/first-liberty-urges-protection-religious-pregnancy-centers/">First
Liberty Institute</a>, a hardball Christian legal outfit, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/09/16/crisis-pregnancy-centers-maura-healey-first-amendment">wrote
to Healey</a>, warning <em>her</em> that “Your office’s hostility
against our clients’ religious beliefs raises serious concerns that you
intend to take legal action against our clients in violation of their
constitutional rights…”</p>
<p>In 2023 the legislature held hearings on “An Act to protect patient
privacy and prevent unfair and deceptive advertising of
pregnancy-related services.” This <a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H377">legislation</a> protects
patient privacy and prevents unfair and deceptive advertising of
pregnancy-related services. It also allocates $1 million to informing
the public about the risks of fake clinics. Predictably, MFI has
ratcheted up its rhetoric on the legislation, calling legislators’
efforts to protect women from medical misinformation and proselytizing a
“gag order.”</p>
<p>On July 5th in Easthampton, the City Council approved an <a
target="_blank" href="https://easthamptonma.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_07052023-2017">addition
to town ordinances</a> that would have <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/easthampton-city-council-expected-to-override-mayor-veto-of-crisis-pregnancy-center-ordinance/ar-AA1eBuTE">explicitly</a>
prohibited city employees from assisting another municipality in the
prosecution of a person seeking an abortion in Easthampton. The
ordinance would also have protected women from being preyed upon by fake
clinics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized in M.G.L. c. 12 § 11I ½ access to reproductive health
care services and gender-affirming health care services is a right
secured by the constitution and laws of the commonwealth. Interference
with this right, whether or not under the color of law, is against the
public policy of the commonwealth and of the City. [¶] This ordinance is
promulgated pursuant to the City’s power to ensure the health, safety
and welfare of the citizens and is intended to provide more stringent
protections than those afforded by the Laws of the Commonwealth or the
United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, for the first time since being elected in 2017, Easthampton
Mayor Nicole LaChapelle <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2023/07/easthampton-mayor-vetoes-city-councils-crisis-pregnancy-center-ordinance.html">vetoed</a>
the ordinance, clearly intimidated by organizations like MFI and the
ADF: “Even with our City Solicitor assuring the ordinance’s legal merit,
we know it will face legal challenges by well-funded organizations
intent on limiting the rights of women and the LGBTQIA+ community.” An

<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/104/199.pdf">Defense of
Marriage Act</a> (DOMA), Public Law 104-199, was a federal law that
explicitly denied same-sex couples the right to marry by creating an
arbitrary definition of marriage. The law was signed by President Bill
Clinton and remained in force from 1996 to 2013. As it became obvious
that DOMA was highly discriminatory and increasingly likely to be ruled
unconstitutional, the Christian right began furiously cranking out
amicus briefs in support of DOMA. In Massachusetts, same-sex marriage
has been legal since May 17, 2004 because of the Supreme Judicial
Court’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://legaldictionary.net/goodridge-v-department-public-health/">ruling</a>
in <em>Goodridge v Department of Public Health</em> that denying
same-sex couples the right to marry violates equal protection of the
laws and <a target="_blank" href="https://legaldictionary.net/due-process/">due
process</a>, thereby violating the Massachusetts <a
target="_blank" href="https://legaldictionary.net/constitution/">Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, fundamentalist preacher Roberto S. Mirando, then- MFI
President Kris Mine, and Robert H. Bradley of the Bradley Family
Foundation and vice-chair of MFI, attempted to create their own
Massachusetts version of DOMA legislation. They <a
target="_blank" href="https://ocpf2.blob.core.windows.net/pdf/filers/95322/95322-cpf101-1-061505.pdf">filed
papers</a> with the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political
Finance (OCPF) to create a ballot initiative, votonmarriage.org, to
promote a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. MFI as an

<p>VoteOnMarriage was accused of forgery and <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch">bait-and-switch</a>
tactics to obtain fraudulent signatures. There were numerous complaints
of improper actions by paid signature gatherers. According to the
Worcester <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/north/2005/10/18/voteonmarriage-defends-its-record/53167817007/">Telegram
&amp; Gazette</a>, “Angela McElroy of Florida, who until recently was a
paid signature gatherer, is expected to testify on what she encountered
during her 2-1/2 weeks working in Massachusetts. She said in an
interview with the Telegram &amp; Gazette that she saw one co-worker
forge signatures from the petition to allow beer and wine sales in
grocery stories to the petition that would put the same-sex marriage
issue on the ballot. She said she also observed some gatherers induce
voters to sign one petition and then slipped the second petition
underneath and asked them to sign that paper without telling them what
they were signing.” Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly launched a
criminal investigation of the <a

“homosexual activists” who simply didn’t want to see the petition
succeed.</p>
<p>In 2011, writing that “MFI is concerned with the untold consequences
same-sex ‘marriages’ will have on American society, moral principles,

Baker v Nelson case, which ruled that there is no fundamental right to
same-sex marriage under the Ninth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Christian Right continued losing state
after state on same-sex marriage. With <a

identity in minors</em>, passed both houses of the legislature and was
signed into law by the then-Republican governor, but not before MFI
mobilized the Christian Right to testify against it. MFI President and

“Some legislators don’t understand that the focus is on eliminating any
counseling options that don’t affirm a LGBT-centric view of human

<h4 id="defending-discrimination-of-school-children"><strong>Defending

<p>In Middleboro, Massachusetts middle schooler <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.standingforfreedom.com/2023/06/federal-court-denies-middle-schoolers-request-to-express-his-belief-that-there-are-only-two-genders/">Liam
Morrison</a> came to school one day with a t-shirt that read “there are
only two genders.” While it might have been slightly more accurate to
say “there are only two sexes,” even that is not quite true, as there
are intersex people, those with chromosomal differences, people whose
external sex characteristics don’t match their genetics, and so on. But
where “gender” is concerned, Christian fundamentalists absolutely reject
modern definitions of gender as vehemently as they reject the Theory of
Evolution.</p>
<p>But here’s what <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gender">Merriam-Webster</a>
has to say about gender:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Among those who study gender and sexuality, a clear delineation
between <em>sex</em> and <em>gender</em> is typically prescribed, with
<em>sex</em> as the preferred term for biological forms, and
<em>gender</em> limited to its meanings involving behavioral, cultural,
and psychological traits. In this dichotomy, the terms <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/male#h1">male</a> and
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/female#h1">female</a>
relate only to biological forms (<em>sex</em>), while the terms <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/masculine#h1">masculine</a>/<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/masculinity">masculinity</a>,
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminine#h1">feminine</a>/<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/femininity">femininity</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woman">woman</a>/<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/girl">girl</a>, and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/man#h1">man</a>/<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boy">boy</a> relate
only to psychological and sociocultural traits (<em>gender</em>). This
delineation also tends to be observed in technical and medical contexts,
with the term <em>sex</em> referring to biological forms in such phrases
as <em>sex hormones</em>, <em>sex organs</em>, and <em>biological
sex</em>. But in nonmedical and nontechnical contexts, there is no clear
delineation, and the status of the words remains complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when Liam Morrison marched into school with his obnoxious t-shirt,
he was presenting his “sincere religious belief” that gender only means
sex. Morrison’s case is currently being appealed by MFI and ADF, and it
is likely he will eventually prevail because he most certainly has a
First Amendment right to his parents’ and pastor’s opinion.</p>
<p>To his school’s credit, it recognized that Morrison’s t-shirt was,
besides being a limited interpretation of <em>gender</em>, mainly
intended to offend, marginalize, and harm fellow non-binary students who
do not rigidly identify with their biological sex. A study by UCLA’s
Williams Institute estimates that in the United States alone there are
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/us/nonbinary-survey-study-number-trnd-wellness/index.html">1.2
million non-binary</a> people, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/nonbinary-lgbtq-adults-us/">majority</a>
of whom are under 29 years of age. According to the UCLA study, life for
teens who identify as non-binary is not easy. Thus the care Morrison’s
school took to ban the t-shirt was intended to reduce injury to other
students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<a
target="_blank" href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Nonbinary-LGBTQ-Tables-Jun-2021.pdf">Tables
A.4 – A.10</a> provide information about stress experiences of nonbinary
LGBTQ people. These data show that a majority of nonbinary people were
hit, beaten, physically attacked, or sexually assaulted (55%) at some
points since they were 18 years old (Figure 5). Also, most felt that
they were less respected (54%) than other people over the year prior to
being interviewed. Many suffered chronic stressors, including not having
enough money to make ends meet (68%), feeling mentally and physically
tired because of their job (68%), being alone too much (56%), and having
strained or conflicted relationships with their parents (60%). Nonbinary
LGBTQ adults also experienced stress in childhood (before age 18, Figure
6), including emotional (82%), physical (40%), and sexual (41%) abuse.
More than one in ten nonbinary people (11%) had gone through conversion
therapy to change their sexual orientation (cis LGBQ respondents) or
gender identity (transgender respondents).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One can only hope that, following Morrison’s likely First Amendment
victory, other students in his school will be permitted to wear t-shirts
bearing <em>their</em> First Amendment-protected opinion of Morrison,
just as he did of them.</p>

<p>In 2018 <a

3</a> asked Massachusetts voters to reject a law signed by Governor
Charlie Baker in 2016 that expanded the state’s existing
nondiscrimination protections for transgender people to include public
accommodations such as bathrooms and locker rooms. Existing law already
protected transgender residents from discrimination in housing and the
workplace. Christian groups <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/alliance-defending-freedom/these-national-anti-lgbtq-groups-are-working-make-anti-trans">came
out in force</a> to oppose Question 3, but despite MFI’s misinformation

tactics</a>, Question 3 affirmed trans rights in Massachusetts by a 67%
majority. Not one county in the Commonwealth wanted to turn back the
clock and strike a civil right. Once again, when put to the voters,
MFI’s bigotry was rejected.</p>
<p>In 2022 MFI partnered with Child and Parental Rights, a legal attack
group, to sue the <a
target="_blank" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.243970/gov.uscourts.mad.243970.1.0.pdf">Ludlow
School Committee</a> and Superintendent, as well as the Principal,
guidance counselor, and librarian of the Baird Middle School for failing
to disclose to two sets of parents of 11 year-old middle schoolers that
their non-binary children were using both pronouns and sex-segregated
bathrooms not matching the sex on their birth certificates. The school
attempted to follow <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/sfs/lgbtq/GenderIdentity.html">DESE
guidance</a> on non-discrimination on the basis of gender. One of the
students was quite clear with their friends and teachers about their
identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hello everyone, If you are reading this you are either my teacher or
guidance counselor. I have an announcement to make and I trust you guys
with this information. I am genderqueer. Basically, it means I use any
pronouns (other than it/its). This also means I have a name change. My
new name will be R. Please call me by that name. If you deadname me or
use any pronouns I am not comfortable with I will politely tell you. I
am telling you this because I feel like I can trust you. A list of
pronouns you can use are: she/her he/him they/them fae/faerae/aer ve/ver
xe/xem ze/zir. I have added a link so you can look at how to say them.
Please only use the ones I have listed and not the other ones. I do not
like them. Thank you. R.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DESE guidance suggests that transgender and gender-nonconforming
students may not be open about their gender identities at home because
of safety concerns or lack of acceptance. For those reasons, teachers in
the state should speak with the students prior to discussing their
gender identity with their parents. But <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr23.html?section=all">state
law</a> (603 CMR 23) referenced in the lawsuit also gives parents of
children under 14 complete control over school records and
communications with guidance counselors and teachers. The legal
distinctions here are that, while information was not explicitly denied
to the parents, it was withheld out of concern for the safety of the
children. Only when one teacher sent an email to parents – actually a
legal violation in itself – did the parents discover their children’s
non-binary identities.</p>
<p>Both sets of parents regard their children’s identities as a mental
illness and their complaint is framed as the school’s neglect in
informing them of a mental problem. The MFI suit references this in the
complaint that the defendants “In reckless disregard of Plaintiffs
Foote’s and Silvestri’s parental rights to make mental health decisions
for their children […] Said Baird Middle School staff did not notify
Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri of these conversations, but instead
followed the Protocol to conceal this information from B.F.’s parents”
MFI’s Beckwith <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/14/metro/four-parents-sue-ludlow-public-schools-policy-that-affirms-transgender-children/">told</a>
<em>The</em> <em>Boston Globe</em>, “By deliberately circumventing the
authority of parents over the mental health and religious beliefs of
their children, activists at the Ludlow schools are violating
time-honored rights guaranteed under the US Constitution and the
Massachusetts Constitution.”</p>
<p>And how was all this framed in the right-wing media’s <a

of the complaint shows, the lawsuit’s prime objective was to completely
hobble <em>any</em> support for non-binary and LGBTQ+ children in the
schools:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The complaint seeks a declaration that teachers and staff may not
facilitate a child’s social transition to a different gender identity
without parental notification. A declaration is also sought that the
related school protocol and associated policies and procedures are to be
publicly rescinded. [..] The complaint seeks a preliminary and permanent
injunction that stops school officials from using the protocol and
related rules as guidance for Ludlow Public Schools. The proposed
injunctions would stop any training of staff to exclude parents in
discussions related to their children’s gender identify, and require
notification of parents should that topic arise in the school setting.
The proposed injunctions would stop school officials from ignoring
parental instructions about gender identify, and stop any meeting with
children to discuss gender identify unless parents are notified.”</p>

sex education</a> amounts to “indoctrination and sexualization,”
particularly if it concerns non-heterosexual relationships, gender, or
sexuality. MFI supports <a target="_blank" href="https://weascend.org/">abstinence</a>

<p>As part of Focus on the Family, MFI <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/parenting/sex-education-how-to-start-early/">recommends</a>
a “biblically holistic approach” to sex ed, which insists on
heterosexuality, rigid sex roles, and instead of science relies on
scripture. If MFI is appalled by secular sex ed, secular parents will be
left scratching their heads by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/parenting/sex-education-how-to-start-early/">this</a>:
“We want our children to understand that the Bible begins in Genesis
with the marriage of a man and a woman and ends in Revelation with the
marriage of Christ and the Church (Revelations 19:7).” How does such
“curriculum” deal with teenage sexual feelings? It teaches about “David
who looked lustfully at Bathsheba and sinned, and Joseph who ran from
Potiphar’s wife when tempted.”</p>
<p>In 2019 MFI’s Director of Community Alliances, Michael King, joined
with predominantly Hispanic church leaders in Worcester to oppose a
local implementation of state educational frameworks with <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-montana/local-education-training/reality-bytes">Planned
Parenthood</a> materials, the Proud Choices curriculum. Members of
King’s church alliance outnumbered secular supporters and wanted their
children to be taught <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/11/26/in-a-blue-state-parents-beat-planned-parenthoods-sex-ed-push/">abstinence
and marriage</a>, objecting particularly to the Proud Choices
curriculum, which is intended for older students likely to engage in
risky sexual behavior and includes references to contraception,
pregnancy, abortion, and STDs. A 2022 study of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/making-proud-choices-evaluation-may-2022.pdf">Proud
Choices curriculum</a> funded by the U.S. Department of Health found a
couple of things MFI might actually appreciate: students who used the
curriculum were more confident refusing sex and overall they had less
sex. However, students had been given facts rather than bible
stories.</p>
<p>MFI’s biblical orientation holds no sympathy for teens discovering
they are gay, trans or non-binary, or for the needs of their parents. In
2013 MFI’s president Andrew Beckwith authored a piece in <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/03/9244/">Public
Discourse</a>, a journal of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witherspoon_Institute">Witherspoon
Institute</a> which funded a discredited study on LGBTQ+ parenting which
pronounced gay parents unfit. Beckwith sputtered that in 2011
Massachusetts prohibited discrimination in public schools on the basis
of gender identity. He went on to attack non-discrimination by appealing
neither to logic nor to law – rather to personal bigotry: “As lawyers,
we perceive the logic of this latest regulatory innovation. But as
fathers, we think that those who are dismayed by MDOE’s regulations are
the only Massachusetts residents who can plausibly claim to be in their
right minds.”</p>
<p>In 2023 newly-elected (and quite “out”) Governor Maura Healey
observed that the state’s sex ed standards had <a
target="_blank" href="https://siecus.org/state_profile/massachusetts-state-profile-23/">not
been updated</a> since 1999, did not even require the subject to be
taught, and were deficient in a number of areas. Healey <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/06/27/maura-healey-massachusetts-sexual-education-curriculum-update-newsletter">proposed</a>
a series of updates that were realized in both <a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S268">legislation</a> and a
new Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) Health and
Physical Education <a

The legislation has <a

in both the House and Senate as well as from the Healthy Youth <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.healthyyouthact.org/">Coalition</a>, and the DESE
draft is a vast improvement over the quarter-century old non-standard.
Among the DESE framework components guaranteed to upset MFI are
sexuality, gender, consent, and contraception. Even though the
accompanying legislation gives parents an opt-out and communities
freedom to tailor the curriculum, MFI has launched a vicious attack on
the standards.</p>
<p>Adoption of the legislation will not be easy. It has been filed
repeatedly for over a decade and has died several times in the
legislature, usually because of <a

<p>In 2021 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2022/04/somerville-school-committee-approves-evangelical-private-school">Vida
Real Church</a> in Somerville applied to open a private school, the Real
Life Learning Center (RLLC), submitting an application to Somerville’s
Subcommittee for Educational Programs. According to the director, Pastor
Luis Morales, “The mission of Real Life Learning Center is to lead the
student into a deep, personal, and growing relationship with the Lord
Jesus Christ. Everything else is secondary.”</p>
<p>With “everything else secondary” the Somerville subcommittee had good
reason to inquire more deeply into what, besides Lord Jesus, students
would be learning. After sending a list of 35 questions to the school,
the school forwarded them to Andrew Beckwith at the MFI instead of
replying to the Board. Initially, then, the school’s approval was
denied.</p>
<p>One subcommittee member, Sara Dion, had specific unanswered concerns:
the school’s policy of admitting only Christian students; teaching
creationism instead of science; the school’s position on homosexuality
and its implications for health education; the school’s approach to
student services and counseling based on a belief that mental illness is
caused by sin and demons; and its methods of discipline being
“Biblically” based (Rods? Stoning?)</p>
<p>Dion was apparently the only subcommittee member asking about the
implications of such mis-education and her questions were perceived as
hostile by MFI and the First Liberty Institute, who <a
target="_blank" href="https://firstliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Somerville-School-Board-Demand-Letter_Redacted.pdf">served
notice</a> on the Somerville Public School Committee. In the end all but
Dion voted to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.ncregister.com/cna/after-religious-controversy-massachusetts-school-board-okays-christian-private-school">approve</a>
the school’s application. A combination of cowardice combined with state
laws that give priority to religion over sound educational principles
had doomed Somerville’s ability to say no to a school that believes
“everything else is secondary” to religious indoctrination.</p>

target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-state-of-emergency">emergency
public health directives</a>. Different classes of organizations and
enterprises were required to adhere to different restrictions, As the
pandemic waned in severity, newer directives began relaxing those
restrictions, though not always in the order or at a pace the public
liked. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-order-66/download?n">Order
66</a> rescinded Order 45 but did not phase out limitations altogether,
a decision based on the typical number of people, and density, in a
given enterprise. This irked New Bedford’s New Life Church, which also
objected to the way the New Bedford Health Department calculated
occupant <a

In 2021, at the request of New Life’s pastor Marco DeBarros, MFI and the
First Liberty Institute <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/10/2226683/0/en/Massachusetts-Church-Asks-Court-to-Toss-Governor-s-Discriminatory-Restrictions-on-Religious-Exercise.html">sued</a>
both Governor Charlie Baker and New Bedford mayor Jon Mitchell, claiming
that “where less onerous COVID-19-related regulations suffice for
comparable secular activities, those same regulations [ought to] suffice
for religious activities. Massachusetts’ regulations fail this standard.
The regulations make it easier to meet at Applebee’s or an AMC theater
than at New Life. This cannot stand.” Ultimately MFI <a

<p>And of course MFI opposes COVID vaccinations. For years Massachusetts
has irresponsibly granted religious exemptions to vaccination against
diseases like diptheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio,
smallpox, and chickenpox, The religious right has never believed
<em>your</em> child’s health was just as important as <em>their</em>
“sincere religious beliefs.” Now a bill in the legislature, <em>An Act
promoting community immunity</em> (<a
target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S1458">S.1458</a>), will
strengthen and modernize tracking of both immunizations for infectious
disease and exemptions to the vaccinations. Contrary to MFI’s
misinformation, parents can still pursue <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.beccarauschma.com/_files/ugd/363892_a5f588338ed54e518eb279f2b2f0ba86.pdf">exemptions</a>;
however they will be processed by the Department of Public Health and
not a school nurse. And more importantly the legislation drops religious
exemptions for these potentially fatal diseases – some of which have <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/why-some-diseases-are-re-emerging-4151072">returned
with a vengeance</a>. Parents will now have to show a valid
<em>medical</em> reason for not immunizing their children if they want
to place them in a congregational public setting (like a classroom) with
other children. MFI is suing.</p>
<h4

conspiracy theories about COVID tracking</strong></h4>
<p>In 2022 the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a right-wing legal advocacy
group, filed a class action lawsuit against the Massachusetts Department
of Health, claiming that it had <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mass-health-officials-google-covid-spyware-1m-phones-lawsuit">conspired
with Google</a> to covertly install a COVID tracking app on one million
Android phones. During the pandemic there were many downloadable apps
that used bluetooth to gather proximity data from other devices with
similar software. The idea was, if you developed COVID you could alert a
health authority and those who had come into contact with you would be
alerted to a potential risk. The concept relied on widespread user
downloads and installation.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Department of Health, together with Apple and
Google, offered such an app called <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/about-massnotify">MassNotify</a>,
which was used by 3.2 million users, of whom 1.8 million <em>were</em>
notified of potential exposure to COVID. New Civil Liberties Alliance
charged that the Massachusetts DOH was pushing the app onto Android
devices, as opposed to via user-initiated downloads. An article in the
online tech journal <a
target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/even-creepier-covid-tracking-google-silently-pushed-app-to-users-phones/">Ars
Technica</a> showed that the state had no role in the rollout but that
Google had indeed used push installs to add a tracking code stub (not a
full-featured app) to Android’s alert mechanism. Users of Google Android
had discovered one more problem with their insecure mobile operating
system. Ignoring facts and nuance, MFI’s Andrew Beckwith <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mass-health-officials-google-covid-spyware-1m-phones-lawsuit">huffed</a>
that this was “yet another example of government bureaucrats using the
COVID hysteria to run roughshod over clear Constitution rights.”</p>
<h4 id="defending-crime-autocracy-and-insurrection"><strong>Defending
Crime, Autocracy, and Insurrection</strong></h4>
<p>In 2019 Christianity Today published an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html">editorial</a>
entitled “Trump Should be Removed from Office.” The centrist magazine
argued that Trump’s temporal actions were illegal, unconstitutional, and
immoral; that his Twitter feed was a “near perfect example” of a human
being “morally lost and confused.” The editorial acknowledged the
political opportunism behind evangelical support of Trump, but the
“impeachment hearings have illuminated the president’s moral
deficiencies for all to see. This damages the institution of the
presidency, damages the reputation of our country, and damages both the
spirit and the future of our people. None of the president’s positives
can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of
such grossly immoral character.”</p>
<p><em>Greater Boston</em> interviewed Evangelicals to get their view on
the influential magazine’s charges. MFI’s Andrew Beckwith didn’t mind if
Trump was an immoral criminal. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=886BxZDiiLo">His take</a> was that
Evangelicals had no choice but to choose an immoral criminal who was
likely to destroy American democracy – as long as Trump delivered to the
200 Evangelicals he cited. Beckwith then reduced it all to abortion,
saying evangelicals had to weigh Trump’s three ex-wives against 60
million “murdered children” since the beginning of Roe v Wade. Beckwith
ended his Trump apologetics by fully embracing authoritarianism when he
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=886BxZDiiLo&amp;t=622s">replied</a>
that MFI was above partisan politics, even democracy, smiling and
pointing out that Jesus was a monarchist who was the “King of Kings,
Lord of Lords.” Which is just what a Christian Dominionist
<em>would</em> say.</p>
<p>And now you know who MFI is.</p>
