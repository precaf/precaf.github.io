<p>Here in the Bay State a major player in the well-financed assault on
secular institutions is the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/">Massachusetts Family Institute</a>
(MFI), a Christian Nationalist organization that, together with its
project <a
target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/p/welcome-to-massachusetts-informed">Massachusetts
Informed Parents</a>, has been involved in various <a
target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/">Culture War issues</a>:
opposing sex education; lying about Planned Parenthood; attacking
libraries and librarians; demonizing the LGBTQ+ community; labelling
teachers “groomers”; and promoting anti-vax misinformation and dealing
in conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>MFI’s president is Andrew Beckwith, who serves as an attorney with
the “Christian liberties” law group <a
target="_blank" href="https://adflegal.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> (ADF), and
whose vice chair is <a
target="_blank" href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43113783">Robert
H. Bradley</a> of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/07/15/bradley-foundation-bankrolled-right-wing-reopen-effort-despite-rising-coronavirus">Bradley
Family Foundation</a>. Beckwith is also <a
target="_blank" href="https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx">associated</a>
with the <a
target="_blank" href="https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx">Renew
Massachusetts Coalition</a>, a 501(c)(4) corporation that targets
legislators, and an anti-abortion Legal Defense Fund. Other board
members include <a
target="_blank" href="https://studentsforlife.org/people/ray-ruddy/">Ray Ruddy</a>, who
is affiliated with the Renew Massachusetts Coalition, Students for Life
of America and Students for Life Action, both in Fredericksburg, VA, and
whose fellow board members include Scott Walker and Leonard Leo. During
the Obama administration <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/lila-rose/who-raymond-ruddy-lila-roses-funder">Ruddy
funded</a> a series of hoax videos attacking Planned Parenthood and
accusing the president of “infanticide.”</p>
<p>MFI, Inc. was <a
target="_blank" href="https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSummary.aspx?sysvalue=kVyCQQWlPL4pRUjQvrcqyxAiy3MY.F4_gAVxQMS2eXA-">incorporated</a>
as a 501(c)(3) with EIN <a
target="_blank" href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/">04-3113783</a> in 1990 as
the <a
target="_blank" href="https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx">Pilgrim
Family Institute</a>, changing its name to the Massachusetts Family
Institute in 1994. A related organization, MFI Action Inc., was <a
target="_blank" href="https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx">incorporated</a>
in 2008 as a 501(c)(4) non-profit with EIN 00-0974938 and was dissolved
in 2014. MFI’s 2019 <a
target="_blank" href="https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/043113783_201912_990_2021030217779797.pdf">Form
990</a> filing, the most recent on the IRS website, shows donations of
$623,050. ProPublica’s nonprofit search tool shows <a
target="_blank" href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43113783/202233189349318763/full">donations
in 2021</a> of $904,875.</p>
<p>While MFI’s pro-life and far-right connections are extremely broad,
MFI’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/national-allies/">National
Allies</a> page lists only its links to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council">Focus
on the Family</a>, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/why-is-hrc-calling-the-family-research-council-a-hate-group-because-it-is-o">Family
Research Council</a>, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/04/10/why-alliance-defending-freedom-hate-group">Alliance
Defending Freedom</a>, and the <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute">First
Liberty Institute</a>. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/search?keyword=adf">Southern Poverty Law
Center</a> (SPLC) designates the first three of these as anti-LGBTQ+
hate groups.</p>
<p>Besides Beckwith, MFI’s staff attorney <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/meet-our-staff/">Sam Whiting</a> also
works for ADF. Whiting attended George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia
Law School, later becoming an Alliance Defending Freedom <a
target="_blank" href="https://blackstonelegalfellowship.org/what-is-blackstone/">Blackstone
Fellow</a>, a program created by ADF to put Christian lawyers into
“positions of influence, thereby impacting the legal culture and keeping
the door open for the Gospel.” Other Fellows include Josh Hawley and Amy
Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>ADF was incorporated in 1993 by <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Mountain_Mandate">Christian
Dominionist</a> Bill Bright, who also founded Campus Crusade for Christ;
Larry Burkett, an evangelical financial advisor; <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-dobson-pushed-out-o_n_495022">James
Dobson</a>, founder of Focus on the Family; <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2022/june/kennedy-coral-ridge-media-hate-group-splc-thomas-defamation.html">D.
James Kennedy</a>, founder of Coral Ridge Ministries; <a
target="_blank" href="https://pointofview.net/us/">Marlin Maddoux</a>, a Christian radio
personality; and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/politico50/2016/alan-sears/">Alan
Sears</a>, former director of the Meese Commission.</p>
<p>ADF attorneys have argued a number of cases before the Supreme Court,
including cases about religion in public schools, the Affordable Care
Act, the legalization of same-sex marriage, business owners’ right to
not provide services for same-sex marriages, and prayers before town
meetings. ADF lawyers wrote the model for Mississippi’s anti-abortion
legislation involved in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,
the decision that overruled the fifty-year-old precedent case Roe v.
Wade establishing the right to abortion.</p>
<p>MFI <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/meet-our-staff/">staff
members</a> include: Michael King, Director of Community Alliances, who
belives democracy must be based on the Bible and who has a degree in
“Christian Leadership” from Liberty University; Mariah Newell,
Communications and Social Media Specialist and former intern with the
Family Research Council; Marci Anthony, Education Research Assistant and
Christian home-schooler; and several others who are co-pastors in
churches with their husbands.</p>
<p>Although MFI’s focus is primarily on forcing its “Christian” notions
of morality, marriage and sexuality on schools, libraries,
non-believers, members of other faiths, and the rest of the public, it
also promotes <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mass-health-officials-google-covid-spyware-1m-phones-lawsuit">conspiracy
theories</a> about vaccination and regards immunization against
communicable diseases to be a matter of individual <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_2024-VaccineBillsBrief.pdf">religious
liberty</a>, not of protecting the public from diseases easily
transmitted by people who refuse to wear masks.</p>
<p>MFI fronts an astroturf group called Massachusetts Informed Parents
(MIP), not a registered non-profit but a project spearheaded by MFI’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/meet-our-staff/">Mary Ellen Siegler</a>,
who with her husband Bill run <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.chosenpeople.com/bill-and-mary-ellen-siegler/">Chosen
People Ministries</a>, a Messianic group that works — despite MFI’s
stated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/about/">mission</a> of
“affirming Judeo-Christian values” — to convert Jews to Christianity.
MIP was originally set up as a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/691040948079576/">Facebook</a>
group by MFI but now publishes a <a
target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/">Substack</a> blog. MIP
offers Christian conservatives a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MIP-Action-Item-List.pdf">checklist</a>
for attacking schools and libraries and maintains a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MIP-Parent-Advisory-Book-List-.pdf">book
banning list</a>. MIP/MFI is categorically opposed to sex education in
schools and advocates only <a
target="_blank" href="https://weascend.org/">abstinence</a> education.</p>
<p>And now you know who MFI is.</p>
