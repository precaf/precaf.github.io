Here in the Bay State a major player in the well-financed assault on secular institutions is the [Massachusetts Family Institute](https://www.mafamily.org/) (MFI), a Christian Nationalist organization that, together with its project [Massachusetts Informed Parents](https://massinformedparents.substack.com/p/welcome-to-massachusetts-informed), has been involved in various [Culture War issues](https://massinformedparents.substack.com/): opposing sex education; lying about Planned Parenthood; attacking libraries and librarians; demonizing the LGBTQ+ community; labelling teachers "groomers"; and promoting anti-vax misinformation and dealing in conspiracy theories.

MFI's president is Andrew Beckwith, who serves as an attorney with the "Christian liberties" law group [Alliance Defending Freedom](https://adflegal.org/) (ADF), and whose vice chair is [Robert H. Bradley](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43113783) of the [Bradley Family Foundation](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/07/15/bradley-foundation-bankrolled-right-wing-reopen-effort-despite-rising-coronavirus). Beckwith is also [associated](https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx) with the [Renew Massachusetts Coalition](https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx), a 501(c)(4) corporation that targets legislators, and an anti-abortion Legal Defense Fund. Other board members include [Ray Ruddy](https://studentsforlife.org/people/ray-ruddy/), who is affiliated with the Renew Massachusetts Coalition, Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action, both in Fredericksburg, VA, and whose fellow board members include Scott Walker and Leonard Leo. During the Obama administration [Ruddy funded](https://www.mediamatters.org/lila-rose/who-raymond-ruddy-lila-roses-funder) a series of hoax videos attacking Planned Parenthood and accusing the president of "infanticide."

MFI, Inc. was [incorporated](https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSummary.aspx?sysvalue=kVyCQQWlPL4pRUjQvrcqyxAiy3MY.F4_gAVxQMS2eXA-) as a 501(c)(3) with EIN [04-3113783](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/) in 1990 as the [Pilgrim Family Institute](https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx), changing its name to the Massachusetts Family Institute in 1994. A related organization, MFI Action Inc., was [incorporated](https://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx) in 2008 as a 501(c)(4) non-profit with EIN 00-0974938 and was dissolved in 2014. MFI's 2019 [Form 990](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/043113783_201912_990_2021030217779797.pdf) filing, the most recent on the IRS website, shows donations of $623,050. ProPublica's nonprofit search tool shows [donations in 2021](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43113783/202233189349318763/full) of $904,875.

While MFI's pro-life and far-right connections are extremely broad, MFI's [National Allies](https://www.mafamily.org/national-allies/) page lists only its links to [Focus on the Family](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council), [Family Research Council](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/why-is-hrc-calling-the-family-research-council-a-hate-group-because-it-is-o), [Alliance Defending Freedom](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/04/10/why-alliance-defending-freedom-hate-group), and the [First Liberty Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute). The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/search?keyword=adf) (SPLC) designates the first three of these as anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups.

Besides Beckwith, MFI's staff attorney [Sam Whiting](https://www.mafamily.org/meet-our-staff/) also works for ADF. Whiting attended George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, later becoming an Alliance Defending Freedom [Blackstone Fellow](https://blackstonelegalfellowship.org/what-is-blackstone/), a program created by ADF to put Christian lawyers into "positions of influence, thereby impacting the legal culture and keeping the door open for the Gospel." Other Fellows include Josh Hawley and Amy Coney Barrett.

ADF was incorporated in 1993 by [Christian Dominionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Mountain_Mandate) Bill Bright, who also founded Campus Crusade for Christ; Larry Burkett, an evangelical financial advisor; [James Dobson](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-dobson-pushed-out-o_n_495022), founder of Focus on the Family; [D. James Kennedy](https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2022/june/kennedy-coral-ridge-media-hate-group-splc-thomas-defamation.html), founder of Coral Ridge Ministries; [Marlin Maddoux](https://pointofview.net/us/), a Christian radio personality; and [Alan Sears](https://www.politico.com/magazine/politico50/2016/alan-sears/), former director of the Meese Commission.

ADF attorneys have argued a number of cases before the Supreme Court, including cases about religion in public schools, the Affordable Care Act, the legalization of same-sex marriage, business owners' right to not provide services for same-sex marriages, and prayers before town meetings. ADF lawyers wrote the model for Mississippi's anti-abortion legislation involved in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the decision that overruled the fifty-year-old precedent case Roe v. Wade establishing the right to abortion.

MFI [staff members](https://www.mafamily.org/meet-our-staff/) include: Michael King, Director of Community Alliances, who belives democracy must be based on the Bible and who has a degree in "Christian Leadership" from Liberty University; Mariah Newell, Communications and Social Media Specialist and former intern with the Family Research Council; Marci Anthony, Education Research Assistant and Christian home-schooler; and several others who are co-pastors in churches with their husbands.

Although MFI's focus is primarily on forcing its "Christian" notions of morality, marriage and sexuality on schools, libraries, non-believers, members of other faiths, and the rest of the public, it also promotes [conspiracy theories](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mass-health-officials-google-covid-spyware-1m-phones-lawsuit) about vaccination and regards immunization against communicable diseases to be a matter of individual [religious liberty](https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_2024-VaccineBillsBrief.pdf), not of protecting the public from diseases easily transmitted by people who refuse to wear masks.

MFI fronts an astroturf group called Massachusetts Informed Parents (MIP), not a registered non-profit but a project spearheaded by MFI's [Mary Ellen Siegler](https://www.mafamily.org/meet-our-staff/), who with her husband Bill run [Chosen People Ministries](https://www.chosenpeople.com/bill-and-mary-ellen-siegler/), a Messianic group that works — despite MFI's stated [mission](https://www.mafamily.org/about/) of "affirming Judeo-Christian values" — to convert Jews to Christianity. MIP was originally set up as a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/691040948079576/) group by MFI but now publishes a [Substack](https://massinformedparents.substack.com/) blog. MIP offers Christian conservatives a [checklist](https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MIP-Action-Item-List.pdf) for attacking schools and libraries and maintains a [book banning list](https://www.mafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MIP-Parent-Advisory-Book-List-.pdf). MIP/MFI is categorically opposed to sex education in schools and advocates only [abstinence](https://weascend.org/) education.

And now you know who MFI is.
