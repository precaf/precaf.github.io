of the United States Capitol on 6 January 2021 - Tyler Merbler
(1/6/2021)</a></p>
<p>Past, Present, Future</p>
<p>Efforts to redress old wrongs and make the country a welcoming place
for people of color, indigenous, gay, trans, and religious minorities
are increasingly met with rage and violence by the American far-right.
The very mention of minorities being denied a share of the American
Dream immediately provokes Republicans to invoke so-called “divisive
concepts.” Social justice has become such a dirty word for the GOP that
they denigrate any effort to address racial and sexual injustices,
whining instead that white people are the real victims of racism.</p>
<p>In the last century and a half, new history and new analyses have
posed uncomfortable questions about our national origins, the nation’s
many wars against black, brown and yellow people, and the dismal truth
about Reconstruction. New analysis poses uncomfortable questions about a
system that generates massive generational wealth for white Americans
but denies people of color similar advantages. New studies shed light on
the myriad systems that adversely affect people of color – housing,
medical, education, police, prisons – and they document in detail how
these systems work and how they are “broken” by design.</p>
<p>If you watched Senator <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-sen-ted-cruz-presses-ketanji-jackson-brown-on-critical-race-theory">Ted
Cruz</a> trying to put Judge Katanji Brown Jackson “in her place” during
her Supreme Court confirmation hearings, you surely heard the phrase “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/344649.Critical_Race_Theory_An_Introduction">Critical
Race Theory</a>” or CRT. Republicans, who have adopted the white
Christian Nationalist critique of scholarship challenging institutional
racism, disparage CRT as the spawn of Marxists, atheists and “woke”
academics who devised it expressly to make white school children
cry.</p>
<p>You probably also heard Senators grilling Judge Jackson about gender,
asking her for an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/23/remarkable-bad-faith-involved-what-is-woman-attack/">open-ended
definition</a> of “woman” while accusing her of lenient sentences for
child pornographers and being complicit with “child sexual predators” in
the “grooming” of victims. Much of this is the stuff of QAnon
conspiracies. Some is part of a White Christian Nationalist agenda that
Republicans openly pursue. The rest is simply terror that America is
changing – and the only tool that Republicans can think of to stop it is
repression.</p>

<p>Republicans lampoon books written to help white liberals understand
how culture and privilege sustain structural racism. They ridicule books
that simply explain how Black folks feel about life in a racist society.
Although they may be read by white people who sometimes clumsily embark
upon a bit of self-reflection, titles like Ibram X. Kendi’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40265832-how-to-be-an-antiracist">How
to be an Anti-Racist</a>” or Michael Eric Dyson’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31421117-tears-we-cannot-stop">Tears
We Cannot Stop</a>” are dismissed by the white Christian Nationalist
Party as malicious and “un-American.”</p>
<p>These blanket dismissals apply as well to popular and well-researched
works: how laws have been written expressly to harm minorities (Richard
Rothstein’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191706-the-color-of-law">The
Color of Law</a>”); how structural racism works in the criminal-legal
system (Michelle Alexander’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458-the-new-jim-crow">The
New Jim Crow</a>”); how racist concepts evolved to justify slavery and
other forms of oppression (Nell Irvin Painter’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6919721-the-history-of-white-people">The
History of White People</a>”); how America was founded on genocide and
slavery (David E. Stannard’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48835.American_Holocaust">American
Holocaus</a>t” or Kendi’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25898216-stamped-from-the-beginning">Stamped
from the Beginning</a>”); and how, for every gain Black America makes,
White America pushes back (Carol Anderson’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073085-white-rage">White
Rage</a>”).</p>
<p>In fact, Anderson absolutely nails it in “White Rage.” White
Christian Nationalists resent having themselves and their “Lost Cause”
called out.</p>
<p>The ferocity of white Christian Nationalists “pushing back” includes
banning or ensuring that books like those mentioned have no place in
libraries or ever find their way into school curricula. Academics who
conduct research, educators who design curriculum, public officials who
turn new findings into policy, or legislators who address social justice
issues – all now find themselves with targets on their backs, placed
there by Republicans with their white Christian Nationalist agenda.</p>
<p>But none of this is new.</p>
<p>Early 20th Century writers like <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.biography.com/writer/james-weldon-johnson">James
Weldon Johnson</a> and <a
target="_blank" href="https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/web-dubois">W.E.B.
DuBois</a>, and mid-century writers like <a

Wright</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://ralphellisonfoundation.org/">Ralph
Ellison</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/lorraine-hansberry">Lorraine
Hansberry</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/james-baldwin">James
Baldwin</a> were widely-known and gave white Americans much to think
about. They may have been literary giants but the wisdom of each was
discounted. Baldwin’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/464260.The_Fire_Next_Time">The
Fire Next Time</a>” (1962) was quickly savaged by American
Conservatives, notably <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/books/review/james-baldwin-fire-next-time.html">William
F. Buckley</a> who called the book a “poignant essay threatening the
whites” and a call for “the end of Christian Civilization” and “morose
nihilism.” White Christian Nationalism was alive and apparent in
America’s best-known <a

Conservative</a> of the day.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/james-baldwin">James Baldwin
1924-1987</a></p>
<p>In 1958 Lederer and Burdick’s “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180100-the-ugly-american">The
Ugly American</a>” created quite the stir when it challenged American
motives, morality and competence as the U.S. began placing “advisors” in
Vietnam. We still feel the divisions that the war in Viet Nam caused.
Some people today will say “thank you for your service” to members of
the military who were directly or indirectly responsible for killing as
many as two million Vietnamese civilians. Others question if the
services these servicemen and women rendered in questionable wars
actually served any constructive purpose.</p>
<p>In 1968 the <a
target="_blank" href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/kerner_commission_full_report.pdf">Kerner
Report</a> pointed out that we were moving inexorably toward two
“separate but unequal” Americas, one Black, one white. The report
pointed to structural and cultural racism in America and it angered
white Americans, including many Liberals. In Chapter 4: Basic Causes, <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner/Kerner_C4.pdf">the
report says</a> bluntly, “… certain fundamental matters are clear. Of
these, the most fundamental is the racial attitude and behavior of white
Americans toward black Americans. Race prejudice has shaped our history
decisively in the past; it now threatens to do so again. White racism is
essentially responsible for the explosive m1965 mcixture which has been
accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II.”</p>
<p>Instead, most white Americans preferred to read about the supposed
moral deficiencies of Black families in overtly racist reports such as
the 1965 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.lc.edu/uploadedFiles/Pages/Services/Reid_Memorial_Library/McCone%20Commission%20Report%20Violence%20in%20the%20City%20Watts%20Neighborhood.pdf">McCone
Commission’s report</a> on the Watts riots or the 1965 <a
target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Moynihan%27s%20The%20Negro%20Family.pdf">Moynihan
Report</a>, which laid blame on Black families and Black culture for
their own mistreatment.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49814857-the-1619-project">1619
Project</a> is a collection of materials curated by Nikole Hannah-Jones
and published by the New York Times which show how the United States was
founded upon slavery and genocide. Like their book-banning German
cousins, Florida explicitly bans 1619 Project materials. Instead, among
the GOP-preferred <a target="_blank" href="https://1776project.org/">1776 Project’s</a>
recommended readings on race, curated by a private Christian university,
is the old Moynihan Report.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin were each
disappointed with white liberals for being unreliable allies in a
struggle for justice that can only succeed with dependable friends.
Baldwin’s seven-hour discussion on race and society in 1970 with
Margaret Mead was eventually transcribed into a book “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484137.A_Rap_on_Race">A Rap on
Race.</a>” Yet for all of Mead’s considerable learning and Yankee
sensibilities, her discussion with Baldwin revealed a white Liberal
blindness to many aspects of racism and privilege. This is a blindness
that extends from simply not “getting it” to complaisance in the face of
white supremacy.</p>

<p>For as long the the United States has existed, facts, research,
science, and statistics have all been at times inconvenient secular
truths for some Americans. In 36 states we have regressed so far into
the past that we have returned to the year 1925, when the state of
Tennessee arrested a teacher, John Thomas Scopes, for violating the
state’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.aclu.org/other/state-tennessee-v-scopes">Butler
Act</a> which criminalized the teaching of “any theory that denies the
story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach
instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.”</p>
<p>Those of us of a certain age remember Spencer Tracy playing a
fictionalized Clarence Darrow in “Inherit the Wind,” pleading movingly
for modernity and science. Perhaps because Darrow’s dialog was so
moving, and perhaps because our founding myths always have a Hollywood
ring to them, it’s easy to forget that Darrow actually lost the case.
John Scopes was found guilty and the Butler Act remained on Tennessee’s
books until 1968 when statutes violating the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment
Clause</a> were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. It took another
decade for Tennessee itself to remove the statute.</p>
<p>The end of Creationism in the schools must have been a hard pill for
white Christian Nationalists to swallow. And they have continued to chip
away at the Establishment Clause.</p>
