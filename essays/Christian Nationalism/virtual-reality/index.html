<p>Americans have become highly segregated into ideological silos. So
much so that if they venture outside their comfort zone they feel
endangered, queasy and agitated — as if they had strapped on a VR
headset and were gazing into an unsettling virtual reality.</p>
<p>People on the Left and Center don’t spend a lot of time in
<em>right-wing</em> virtual reality. And the reverse is true. The
far-right certainly doesn’t place a high premium on science, verifiable
fact or primary sources.</p>
<p>For example, you would be hard-pressed to find many Republicans who
have actually read any of the authors of foundational texts on things
they despise — like Critical Race Theory, for instance. Instead, they
rely on a network of think tanks and crackpots to interpret and
propagandize.</p>
<p>I mean, why read Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic — two of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Race-Theory-Introduction-America/dp/0814721354">founders</a>
of Critical Race Theory — when you can read the Manhattan Institute’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Rufo">Christopher
Rufo</a>, who has a long history with far-right think tanks — and in one
gig with the Discovery Institute promoted Creationism for a living?</p>
<p>Now, I am pretty sure my version of reality contains a bit more,
well, <em>reality</em> than the right-wing’s virtual world. But it’s
important to inform oneself. And not only do I trust primary sources
over second-hand accounts, but I want to know what these people actually
think, and why.</p>
<p>Just like liberals, the right-wing has its own news sources. FOX News
may be the best-known, but any list should include Breitbart News, Epoch
Times, WND, One America News, the Daily Signal, Daily Caller, Gateway
Pundit, the Blaze, and a variety of Christian-<em>ish</em> news sources
that offer everything from weather reports and dating advice to
devotionals and End Times prophecy.</p>
<p>Then there are the social networks. <em>Parenthetically</em>, let me
just say that it has been a huge mistake to “deplatform” right-wing
crackpots by kicking them off Facebook and Twitter. These exiled
“thought-leaders” have simply fled to right-wing social networks like
Gab, Gettr, Parler, and Trump’s new (and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/09/truth-social-trump-app-failed-products">still
not working</a>) Truth Social — dragging all their supporters with them,
where they may be out of sight but are still very much out of their
minds. Only, now it’s more difficult to track what they’re up to.</p>
<p>Platforms like Bitchute, Rumble, and PlayerFM host videos and
podcasts that might not pass muster on mainstream media streaming
services. The messaging program Telegram has also become a popular app
for hosting far-right chat groups.</p>
<p>For those determined to keep a toe in the mainstream, YouTube is
still an option for delivering content — unless the content creator is
spreading COVID disinformation or raises some other flag. Some will just
bite their tongues and show a little restraint in order to stay on
Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>I signed up for Gettr, Parler, Truth Social and Telegram. Gab has
been removed from both the Apple and Google stores so I couldn’t try it,
and I was never able to actually use Truth Social because two months
after signing up I’m still in a waiting queue.</p>
<p>Just like Facebook and Twitter, each turned out to be primarily an
echo chamber for news and opinion pieces published elsewhere. The level
of civility was no worse than on Facebook or Twitter. But far from being
oases of free expression, right-wing social networks <em>do</em> censor
liberal views. Trump Truth Social reportedly goes so far as to <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/trumps-free-speech-app-truth-social-is-censoring-content-and-kicking-off-users-023153584.html">ban
criticisms</a> of Donald Trump.</p>
<p><img src="media.png" /></p>
<p>I ultimately gave up on the right-wing social networks (as I did long
ago with their mainstream cousins), instead turning my attention to news
and opinion pieces from think tanks and news sources that manufacture
(not simply echo) right-wing virtual reality and right-wing talking
points.</p>
<p>One of these talking point on which I agree wholeheartedly is that
social networks <em>really do</em> pose a problem to democracy with
their censorship.</p>
<p>Not only have COVID disinformation spreaders and the most repellent
of racists run afoul of censors, but so have socialists, commentators
who may have appeared on Russian media at one time or another, foreign
policy critics, supporters of the BDS movement, Israel critics, Russian
artists and musicians, newspapers covering whatever there is to report
on Hunter Biden’s laptop, and those now falling victim to American
social media’s new mission as a partisan in the West’s sanctioning of
Russia.</p>
<p>But let’s not blame any one party for this. Censorship and forced
political and social exile has been a bipartisan phenomenon as long as
I’ve lived — and that’s a life that includes the McCarthy era.</p>
<p>Putin’s invasion of the Ukraine — despicable as it is — has led to
the West pulling out all the stops to ban Russian <em>anything</em> and
even snatching internet domains. The almost McCarthyite frenzy which
Putin’s invasion has unleashed serves to remind us that internet freedom
exists only at the pleasure of Western governments and their <a
target="_blank" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/4187775.pdf">digital
gatekeepers</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that corporations have now become deputized agents of state
policy should also <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/21/concerns-about-democracy-in-the-digital-age/">shock
us</a>. Because if there is no daylight between the media and the state,
or if the media is deeply “embedded” with the state (a phenomenon that
the Iraq War highlighted), then it’s ultimately the <em>state</em>
itself that is engaged in censorship.</p>
<p><em>That</em> said, the American Right has never been more dangerous
than it is today. It is truly an enemy of democracy and tolerance, and a
racist and misogynistic force of repression that hasn’t given up on the
idea of erasing any separation of church and state. And today, while
those of us on the Left and Center bicker, all the far-right’s moving
parts are firing in synch like pistons in a well-tuned V8 engine.</p>
<p>The final layer of right-wing opinion-shaping is a stunningly vast
network of right-wing think tanks and well-funded foundations which
include ALEC, Christian Coalition, Civics Alliance, Claremont Institute,
Colson Center, Coolidge Foundation, Eagle Forum, Family Research
Council, Federalist, Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism (!),
FreedomWorks, Gingrich 360, Heritage Foundation, Hoover Institution,
Manhattan Institute, National Association of Scholars, National Legal
Foundation, Pioneer Institute — and hundreds (if not thousands)
more.</p>
<p><img src="feedly.png" /></p>
<p>But don’t take my word for any of this. Follow the American
right-wing yourself. <a target="_blank" href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is a great
tool for following <a
target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-are-rss-feeds-e8aaebc3-a0a7-40cd-9e10-88f9c1e74b97">RSS
feeds</a>. Whenever a new article from any one of the 70 right-wing
media outlets I follow is published, it appears in Feedly. If you want
to start with my list, you can download my <a
target="_blank" href="https://precaf.github.io/links/right-wing.opml">OPML
configuration</a> and import it into your own Feedly account or most any
<a target="_blank" href="https://bloggingwizard.com/free-rss-feed-readers/">RSS
reader</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are a number of organizations that also follow the
American Right. Some of the best are the Southern Poverty Law Center,
Right Wing Watch, Political Research Associates, the Anti-Defamation
League, the Freedom from Religion Foundation, the Institute for Research
and Education on Human Rights, the ACLU, and the NAACP.</p>
<p>Read them, donate to them, and take their warnings seriously. And — I
won’t say “enjoy” — but good luck in your own explorations of right-wing
virtual reality.</p>
