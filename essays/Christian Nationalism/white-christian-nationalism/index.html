<p>Christian Nationalism has been with us almost from the founding of
this country. And it has always combined the worst elements of national
myth and religion.</p>
<p>The nation was barely a year old when the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation">Articles
of Confederation</a> (1777) were written. A decade later the Articles
were superseded by the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.docsteach.org/documents/document/constitution">Constitution
of the United States</a> (1787), a document drafted in secret sessions
by land speculators, Federalists and creditors, and regarded by some
today as somewhat of a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey-Hummel/publication/239831367_The_Constitution_as_Counter-Revolution_A_Tribute_to_the_Anti-_Federalists/links/56095dcf08ae4d86bb11cfeb/The-Constitution-as-Counter-Revolution-A-Tribute-to-the-Anti-Federalists.pdf">counter-revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Before ratification, the Federalists (mainly Alexander Hamilton and
James Madison) sharpened their quills to sell their new form of
government organization to the skeptics. Many of these documents were
collected and are known as the <a
target="_blank" href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text">Federalist
Papers</a>. Federal versus state rights arguments are nothing new.</p>
<p>No sooner was the ink dry on the Constitution than Americans lost
their collective minds to the <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening_(United_States)">Second
Great Awakening</a> (1790-1840), another in a series of religious
revivals that rejected many of the Constitution’s supposed democratic
values (although not as resoundingly as the very fact of slavery).</p>
<p>The United States may have been born respecting the separation of
Church and State, but religion had no respect for the laws of man and,
almost from the beginning, began undermining secular law and
government.</p>
<p>Barely half a century into the new experiment in government the
United States was deeply divided, which led eventually to the Civil War.
The South rejected even token Enlightenment values professed by
Northerners and Europeans and ended up with its own <a
target="_blank" href="https://brill.com/downloadpdf/journals/fasc/8/2/article-p307_307.pdf">concept
of modernity</a>. That modernity happened to include a romantic, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382189.Baptized_in_Blood">chivalric</a>,
religious, deeply hierarchical and repressive culture, an agrarian
economy based on slavery, with a national myth based on blood and soil.
On the other side of the ocean a nationalist myth based on the same
<em>Blut und Boden</em> was emerging in what would eventually become
Germany.</p>
<p>Partly as a consequence of its defense of slavery but also due to
growing economic and intellectual isolation, Southern Christianity soon
diverged from that of Northern Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist
churches. Because of the role imputed to Southern clergy in upholding
social norms, the defense of slavery became their responsibility — one
carried out with great enthusiasm and creativity. South Carolina
Presbyterian minister James Henley Thornwell’s <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/ASPC0001984800">The Rights and Duties
of Masters</a></em> offers an example of the tortured logic found in
many slavery apologetics.</p>
<p>As Stefan Roel Reyes points out, there were stunning similarities
between the proto-fascism of post-Weimar Germany and the Confederate
States of America. But there were equally stunning historical
differences. In <em>The Lost Cause Rides Again</em> <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/08/no-confederate/535512/">Ta-Nehisi
Coates</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The distinction matters. For while the Confederacy, as a political
entity, was certainly defeated, and chattel slavery outlawed, the racist
hierarchy which Lee and Davis sought to erect, lives on. It had to. The
terms of the white South’s defeat were gentle. Having inaugurated a war
which killed more Americans than all other American wars combined, the
Confederacy’s leaders were back in the country’s political leadership
within a decade. Within two, they had effectively retaken control of the
South. […] Nazi Germany was also defeated. But while its surviving
leadership was put on trial before the world, not one author of the
Confederacy was convicted of treason. Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von
Ribbentrop was hanged at Nuremberg. Confederate General John B. Gordon
became a senator. Germany has spent the decades since World War II in
national penance for Nazi crimes. America spent the decades after the
Civil War transforming Confederate crimes into virtues. It is illegal to
fly the Nazi flag in Germany. The Confederate flag is enmeshed in the
state flag of Mississippi.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How the South lost the war but managed to preserve its “Lost Cause”
has been a topic studied in depth. One excellent treatment is Charles
Reagan Wilson’s <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382189.Baptized_in_Blood">Baptized
in Blood</a>: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920</em>.</p>
<p>The amber that preserved the Lost Cause was Southern Christianity — a
vessel which preserved not only the moral fervor and anti-secularism of
the old-time religion but disgust for federalism and apologetics for
repression and slavery.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the North and South each developed
separate national myths and flavors of Christianity. Wilson notes that a
“civil religion” reflects both the political and religious views of a
nation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A civil religion, by definition, centers on the religious
implications of a nation. The Southern public faith involved a nation —
a dead one, which was perhaps the unique quality of this phenomenon. One
of the central issues of the [Northern] American faith has been the
relationship between church and state, but since the Confederate quest
for political nationhood failed, the Southern faith has been less
concerned with such political issues than with the cultural question of
identity. Because it emerged from a heterogeneous immigrant society, the
[Northern] American civil religion was especially significant in
providing uprooted immigrants with a sense of belonging. Because of its
origins in Confederate defeat, the Southern civil religion offered
confused and suffering Southerners a sense of meaning, an identity in a
precarious but distinct culture.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solemn quasi-religious rituals, often relating to the military,
evolved in both North and South. In the North’s case, the Union was the
Cause that Won. For the South, the Confederacy was the Lost Cause.</p>
<p>Let us now set the calendar ahead, only a few decades from the
present, when thousands of Confederate monuments were erected to
preserve the honor and nobility of Confederate generals (but so did the
North). Almost all were dedicated with blessings from the clergy. And
when the South embarked upon an orgy of lynchings, once again, many were
<a
target="_blank" href="https://bibleandhistory139759484.wordpress.com/2020/08/05/lynching-in-the-united-states/">carried
out right after church</a> for the convenience and enjoyment of white
congregants. The terror of “Christian” KKK members and lynch mobs
continued through the years with the bombings of Black churches, murders
of Black ministers, and cross burnings.</p>
<p>Some Christian Nationalists are simply opportunists (Republicans) or
extremists (neo-Nazis with their Aryan “churches”). But although white
Christian Nationalism hardly represents the teachings of Christianity it
is nevertheless found disproportionately within the Evangelical movement
that formed it — even as many Evangelicals reject it.</p>
<p>Take <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/june/cru-divided-over-emphasis-on-race.html">Campus
Crusade for Christ</a> (now called “Cru”) for example. The Evangelical
organization realized it had a race problem and brought in diversity
trainers. The pushback from Cru’s more <a
target="_blank" href="https://capstonereport.com/2021/05/11/cru-trainings-promote-anti-white-anti-american-rhetoric/36002/">nationalist</a>
Evangelicals was swift and angry. Similarly, the <a
target="_blank" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/critical-race-theory-divides-the-southern-baptist-convention.html">Southern
Baptist Conference</a> is now divided into religious and nationalist
factions over the issue of Critical Race Theory.</p>
<p>But for a “pro-life” community supposedly steeped in the love of
Jesus, nationalist Evangelicals are known to be more <a

<p>Many of today’s culture wars have been launched by these followers of
Jesus. But the version of Jesus they revere is not the man of miracles
and multitudes who showed compassion for a woman about to be stoned to
death. For Christian Nationalists the canonical Jesus is a lamentable
“woke” sissy who would turn the other cheek, look for the best in
people, oppose exploitation, and feed the hungry.</p>
<p>Instead, the version of Jesus best represented by Evangelical opinion
polls is the vengeful killer from Revelations 19:13, riding in on a war
horse, robe dripping with blood, eyes blazing with fury, sword slashing,
bronze boots stomping to death anyone who ever got in his way.</p>
<p><a
target="_blank" href="https://politicalresearch.org/2021/04/20/white-evangelical-racism">Anthea
Butler</a>, a Black theologian, professor, and author of <em>“White
Evangelical Racism</em>,” described in an interview with Political
Research Associates how Evangelicals became politicized by religious
crusades starting in the Forties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As early as the 1940s, Billy Graham had fused Christianity with
patriotism and White supremacy. His goal was to make believers—including
Black and Brown folks who had started to listen to him—conform to White,
male, Western Christian ideals. He demonized Communists, Catholics, and
immigrants. Interestingly, he got support from William Randolph Hearst’s
<em>Los Angeles Examiner,</em> which gave these ideas added prominence.
[…] American exceptionalism—the idea that the U.S. is blessed by God—as
well as Christian patriotism were used by Billy Graham, the Rev. Bob
Jones, and other White male religious leaders of the mid-20th Century to
put parameters around what it meant to be an American and a Christian.
It does lead directly to MAGA.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While overt expressions of racism may be out of fashion even as the
nation has begun to acknowledge its own racist institutions, nationalist
Evangelicals stubbornly deny the existence of racism and actively
campaign to shut down any public discussion of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even though some White evangelicals have made statements about
racial reconciliation, or even ‘color blindness,’ right now they’re
fussing about having to discuss critical race theory. They’re upset
about the 1619 Project’s focus on the racist underpinnings of the United
States. And even though Southern Baptists apologized for slavery in
1995, they have not changed any of their behaviors so you can see
through their statements and conclude that they’re posturing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2010 the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights with
the assistance of the NAACP published <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irehr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/images_pdf_TeaPartyNationalism.pdf">Tea
Party Nationalism</a></em>. This was one of the first warnings about
white supremacist, neo-Nazi, pro-KKK, and Christian Nationalist elements
within several of the <em>not-so-grassroots</em> Republican groups.
IREHR has a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irehr.org/tea-party-nationalism/">website</a> that
updates recent developments.</p>
<p>In 2011, Matt Barreto and others published <em><a
target="_blank" href="https://mattbarreto.com/papers/teaparty_PPST.pdf">The Tea Party in
the Age of Obama</a>: Mainstream Conservatism or Out-Group Anxiety?</em>
in Political Power and Social Theory. The paper made the case that the
Tea Party had transitioned from pseudo-conservative to simply
“paranoid,” that the movement harbored white nationalists, and that
their concerns were mainly centered around changing American
demographics.</p>
<p>In 2018 the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism published
<em><a
target="_blank" href="https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/New-Hate-and-Old_The-Changing-Face-of-American-White-Supremacy_2018_1.pdf">New
Hate and Old</a>: The Changing Face of American White Supremacy</em>,
which documented the rise of the Christian Identity movement, a good
example of White Nationalism outside the Evangelical movement.</p>
<p>In February 2022 the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty
(BJC) and the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) jointly published
<em><a
target="_blank" href="https://bjconline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Christian_Nationalism_and_the_Jan6_Insurrection-2-9-22.pdf">Christian
Nationalism at the January 6, 2021, Insurrection</a></em>. The authors
described a long history of similar displays of white Christian
nationalist power, starting with the 1925 KKK March in Washington,
DC.</p>
<p>We have come a long way from antebellum Southern Christianity to the
Evangelical Christianity that preserved the essence of the Lost Cause;
from Billy Graham’s crusades to the Tea Party; from the emergence of
white Christian Nationalism to Trump; and the metamorphosis of all this
into today’s Republican Party.</p>
<p>And we’ve barely scratched the surface. The 1936 presidential
election, for example, is worth looking at if you want to see how
Christian Nationalism played out within several political parties and
managed to attract real-life Nazis for the first time.</p>
<p>America’s illiberal impulses have had a long trajectory. It’s
astonishing that the Party of Lincoln is now largely a bunch of white
supremacists hiding behind a cross. But this is who they are and who we
must fight.</p>
