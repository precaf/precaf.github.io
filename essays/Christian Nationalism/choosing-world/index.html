<p>The Supreme Court, as an increasingly illegitimate institution, has
robbed the majority of its civil liberties while granting Christian
Nationalists a wish list long denied by the Constitutional separation of
church and state. In a perversion of judicial interpretation,
discrimination no longer exists — unless it’s <em>us</em> pushing back
on the “rights” of Christian Nationalists to discriminate for
“religious” reasons.</p>
<p>The Court’s rulings have emboldened the Christian right to attack
every secular institution — including schools, libraries, school boards
— and the Court grants them permission to suppress Black history,
demonize LGBTQ+ people, and censor ideas and science that conflict with
their own narrow religious views.</p>
<p>This new era of Christian fundamentalism could last 30 years, or will
hopefully be of shorter duration. But a sharp and angry reaction to
religious repression will likely follow. Around 2016 Ireland began
repealing repressive laws based on its long troubled relationship with
the Church. France, once overrun by saints and cathedrals, is now
hostile to religion and is among the top ten countries with the largest
percentage of atheists. Germany, the seat of the Holy Roman Empire and
the birthplace of Protestantism, is now one of the least religious
nations in Europe. While familiarity doesn’t necessarily breed contempt,
it often leads to a realization that religion is toxic to democracy.
It’s even beginning to dawn on Israelis that their tolerance of
religious extremism – <em>in a religious state!</em> – is about to cost
them their democracy – at least the one on <em>their</em> side of the
Green Line.</p>
<p>Of the articles I read this morning, two couldn’t have been more
different.</p>
<p>One was from <a
target="_blank" href="https://massinformedparents.substack.com/p/lets-have-a-serious-talk-about-lexington">Massachusetts
Informed Parents</a>, a project of the Christian Nationalist
Massachusetts Family Institute, which tries to force their “Christian”
values down everybody’s throats, particularly in matters of education.
MFI was incensed that the Lexington schools talk to kids about the
diversity found in their own district, about skin color, understanding
that some parents are not mom and dad but mom and mom, or that sometimes
people suffer silently from disabilities. That some boys and some girls
don’t like to play with toys traditionally associated with their sex. Or
that we have to be respectful of how people think of themselves, that
some people are white, some black, some bi- and multi-racial. Or ask:
what is empathy? All this is simply too much for the “Christians” at
MFI, who think that any discussion of empathy and acceptance “makes it
easier to turn kids into good little activists.”</p>
<p>The other was a wonderful essay by <a
target="_blank" href="https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/i-celebrate-the-opportunity-to-be-a-queer-educator/">Suzanne
Stillinger</a>, a queer early childhood educator who does the work that
MFI despises so much, and who took the opportunity in Commonwealth
Magazine to thank her community for embracing her and the work she does
in Northampton. Stillinger addresses the Christian Right’s objection to
her work: “The epithet ‘groomer,’ a new slur <a

on a tired and very old stereotype</a>, is being tossed at any adult who
supports LGBTQ+ rights, but is especially damaging when directed at
those of us who work with children. There are those who insist that
talking about LGBTQ+ identities radicalizes children, when all of the
data tells us that <a
target="_blank" href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrevorproject.org%2Fresources%2Farticle%2Ffacts-about-lgbtq-youth-suicide%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cbmohl@massinc.org%7C2550a225ceeb4b8c766c08db9ebf0581%7C2e4281ac78ee4d85a6c5083153ea1b48%7C1%7C0%7C638278315517064230%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=cZQidLiU1s7OZLL2s1BSejxsbOsHhouJPaZmWe6%2F2Mc%3D&amp;reserved=0">the
true risk lies in denying children access to information and support</a>
that validates their full sense of self and belonging.”</p>
<p>So, what we see here are two ways of living in and seeing the world.
One seeks to preserve hate and ill-judgement while marginalizing certain
people, and to keep children’s eyes closed to both injustice and a
changing world. The other is to open children’s eyes to social
realities, and to celebrate the differences and the beauty of diversity
in their communities, schools, and classrooms – to foster acceptance and
solidarity, not hate.</p>
<p>There was a time when Americans wanted to say, “we’re all in this
together.” I think we still want to. The work the Lexington and
Northampton schools are doing affirms this way of moving within the
world. In contrast, the toxic efforts of hate groups like MFI and MIP
only undermine social cohesion.</p>
<p>The choice really is this stark – we have to choose the kind of world
we want to live in.</p>
