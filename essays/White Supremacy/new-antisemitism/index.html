<p>It seems like a day doesn’t go by without a mosque being blocked, burnt, or picketed by racists. An ignorant “patriot” murders a group of Sikhs because he thinks they’re Muslims. Republicans, besides their usual dismissal of Blacks, gays and Latinos, show a special fondness for demonizing Muslims. Congressman Peter King regularly convenes McCarthyesque show hearings on the Muslim Menace. And in two dozen states these haters have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/09/139168699/whos-behind-the-movement-to-ban-shariah-law">filed “anti-Shariah” legislation</a> authored by a Jewish White Supremacist that serves no purpose other than to show their hatred of Muslims and to proclaim their preference for the “Judeo-Christian” way of life.</p>
<p><img src="god-hates-jews-150x150.jpg" title="god-hates-jews" /></p>
<p>CAIR, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/fbi-dramatic-spike-in-hate-crimes-targetin">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-potok/fbi-reports-dramatic-spik_b_1092996.html">FBI</a>, all report an alarming increase in murders, assaults, arson, and property damage directed against Muslims. Hate crimes against Muslims are up 50% — and it’s largely the byproduct of a small group of <a target="_blank" href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=8538">Islamophobic extremists</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/expose-islamophobia-industry-article-1.1109263">well-financed</a> crusade that cranks out books, blogs, and movies <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_of_Muslims">like the one that surfaced last week</a> — and which funds think tanks and talking heads on FOX News and other right wing outlets. Disturbingly, these hate-filled messages are nothing but recycled antisemitism: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1031697/We-Muslims-new-Jews-says-MP-victim-hit-run-firebomb-attack.html">Muslims are the new Jews</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremiahhaber.com/2010/08/islamophobia-as-new-antisemitism.html">Islamophobia is the new antisemitism</a>.</p>

<p>Although today some regard it a sign of an enlightened democracy to permit Muslim-bashing and hate speech of this sort to go unchallenged, let’s not kid ourselves: <em>hate propaganda kills</em>. The Holocaust and the thousands of attacks in recent years on Muslims and those perceived to be “soft” on them by the far right, such as in Norway last year, illustrate this all too well. But there was a time when the United States recognized the lethality of hate speech. In October of 1946, during the Nuremberg trials, Nazi propagandist<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Streicher.html#CONCLUSION">Julius Streicher was hanged</a> — not for murder but for his “journalistic” career devoted to demonizing Jews.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://middleclassdub.blogspot.com/2011/10/islamophobia-and-antisemitism-same.html">Colm O’Broin</a> has compared some of Streicher’s antisemitic screeds to current Islamophobic talking points written primarily by Robert Spencer, who is a friend and advisor to just about every right-wing ideologue in the United States, not to mention the author of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/fbi-islam-101-guide/">now-discredited</a> FBI training materials. Many of the quotes O’Broin chose are taken from the Nuremberg trial transcripts or Streicher’s propaganda paper, Der Stürmer. In a few cases I have changed O’Broin’s wording or chosen a different quote. I have also added two points. Clicking on an author’s link will bring up the original quote.</p>
<p>Below are the main points both the Nazi antisemites and contemporary Islamophobes hammer away on. They are amazingly, eerily, disturbingly similar.</p>

<h3 id="muslimsjews-have-a-religious-duty-to-conquer-the-world.">1. Muslims/Jews have a religious duty to conquer the world.</h3>
<p>“Islam understands its earthly mission to extend the law of Allah over the world by force.” — Robert Spencer</p>

<p>" FDI acts against the treason being committed by national, state, and local government officials, the mainstream media, and others in their capitulation to the global jihad and Islamic supremacism, the ever-encroaching and unconstitutional power of the federal government, and the rapidly moving attempts to impose socialism and Marxism upon the American people." — <a target="_blank" href="http://freedomdefense.typepad.com/about.html">Freedom Defense Initiative, a Robert Spencer/Pamela Geller organization</a></p>
<p>“The government allows the Jew to do as he pleases. The people expect action to be taken.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/nca/nca-02/nca-02-16-streicher-10-02.html">Julius Streicher</a></p>

<h3 id="the-evidence-against-muslimsjews-is-in-their-holy-books.">6. The evidence against Muslims/Jews is in their holy books.</h3>
<p>“What exactly is ‘hate speech’ about quoting Qur’an verses and then showing Muslim preachers using those verses to exhort people to commit acts of violence, as well as violent acts committed by Muslims inspired by those verses and others?” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/2011/07/daniel-greenfield-in-defense-of-robert-spencer.html">Robert Spencer</a></p>
<p>“In Der Stürmer no editorial appeared, written by me or written by anyone of my main co-workers, in which I did not include quotations from the ancient history of the Jews, from the Old Testament, or from Jewish historical works of recent times.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-12/tgmwc-12-116-01.shtml">Julius Streicher</a></p>
<h3 id="islamicjewish-texts-encourage-violence-against-non-believers.">7. Islamic/Jewish texts encourage violence against non-believers.</h3>
<p>“And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter…” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/2011/08/wapo-do-critics-actually-read-the-koran-uh-yeah.html">Surah 2:191, a Koranic verse quoted by Robert Spencer on Jihadwatch.org</a></p>
<p>“Deuteronomy 7:16 expresses that command to hate that Moses received at Sinai from the Jewish God Jahwe. It says: ‘You will destroy all the peoples of the earth, whom Jahwe will give into your hands. You shall have no mercy on them.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/04-29-46.asp">inaccurate Biblical verse quoted by Julius Streicher in Der Stürmer</a></p>
<h3 id="christianity-is-peaceful-while-islamjudaism-is-violent.">8. Christianity is peaceful while Islam/Judaism is violent.</h3>
<p>“There is no Muslim version of ‘love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you’ or ‘if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn to him the other also’.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eanFm7hiM1cC&amp;lpg=PA27">Robert Spencer in “Islam Unveiled”</a></p>
<p>“The Jew is not being taught, like we are, such texts as, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,’ or ‘If you are smitten on the left cheek, offer then your right one.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-04/tgmwc-04-31-07.shtml">Julius Streicher</a></p>
<h3 id="muslimsjews-are-uniquely-violent.">9. Muslims/Jews are uniquely violent.</h3>
<p>“(Islam) is the only major world religion with a developed doctrine and tradition of warfare against unbelievers.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/280529/response-matt-duss-defamation-any-other-name-robert-spencer">Robert Spencer</a></p>
<p>“No other people in the world has such prophecies. No other people would dare to say that it was chosen to murder and destroy the other peoples and steal their possessions.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/ds6.htm">Julius Streicher</a></p>
<h3 id="criticising-muslimsjews-is-not-incitement-to-violence-against-muslimsjews.">10. Criticising Muslims/Jews is not incitement to violence against Muslims/Jews.</h3>
<p>“There is nothing in anything that I have ever written that could be reasonably construed as an incitement to violence against anyone.” — Robert Spencer</p>
<p>“Allow me to add that it is my conviction that the contents of Der Stürmer as such were not (incitement). During the whole 20 years, I never wrote in this connection, ‘Burn Jewish houses down; beat them to death.’ Never once did such an incitement appear in Der Stürmer.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/04-29-46.asp">Julius Streicher</a></p>
<h3 id="god-bashing-the-muslimjewish-god-is-not-our-god">11. God-Bashing: The Muslim/Jewish God is not “our” God</h3>
<p>It’s not enough to demonize a people and their religion. Ultimately, you have to blame their God. And in order to do that, you have to deny that their God is the same as yours. Hey, the Nazis did it. The Islamophobes have followed suit.</p>
<p>“In the same way, it is possible that the Qur’an and Islamic tradition present a picture of God so radically different from that of the Bible and Catholic tradition that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain the proposition that they are the same Being in both traditions, apart from some minor creedal differences.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crisismagazine.com/2012/do-catholics-and-muslims-worship-the-same-god">Robert Spencer</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/2005/06/is-allah-god.html">this</a> too</p>
<p>“Deuteronomy 7:16 expresses that command to hate that Moses received at Sinai from the Jewish God Jahwe. It says: ‘You will destroy all the peoples of the earth, whom Jahwe will give into your hands. You shall have no mercy on them.” — <a target="_blank" href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/04-29-46.asp">inaccurate Biblical quote by Julius Streicher in Der Stürmer</a></p>
<h3 id="people-who-defend-muslimsjews-are-secret-race-traitor-followers">12. People who defend Muslims/Jews are secret race-traitor followers</h3>
<p>When it’s not sufficient to bash governments for failing to wage a pogrom on Jews/Muslims, you have to resort to name-calling. Progressive Democrats and others who refuse to demonize Muslims must be Muslims themselves, just as for Streicher the FDR administration had all become Jewish, as if by a bacterial infection. Streicher pre-dated Orly Taitz’s Birtherism and the Tea Party’s obsession with Shariah Law in his “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/ds1.htm">What is Americanism</a>?”</p>
