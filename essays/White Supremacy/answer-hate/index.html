<p>This my last appeal for citizens to advocate for protections for immigrant families in the 2019 budget. Originally proposed as <a target="_blank" href="amendment-1147.pdf">Budget Amendment #1147</a> by Senator James Eldridge, these protections have been incorporated into <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/S2530.pdf">Senate Bill S.2530</a> and are now in conference with the House. Call your <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator">State House Representative</a> to ask them to support immigrant family protections. What’s happening in Washington should terrify and motivate state House Democrats to support such protections. This should be our answer to hate.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why the protections are so important</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court just ruled in favor of <strong>Trump’s Muslim Ban</strong>. An <a target="_blank" href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/no-muslim-ban-ever">ACLU petition</a> asks Congress to pass legislation to block racist exclusions like this. While a ban is not the same thing as a registry, we don’t yet know how Trump’s Muslim Ban will affect citizens of the Muslim-majority countries who live in Massachusetts, whether CPB, ICE, or DHS will ask the Commonwealth to help track these Muslim neighbors — or if the occasional law enforcement official might have personal motivations to share data with ICE without authorization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protections for immigrant families in the 2019 budget bar the Commonwealth from cooperating with such registries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trump’s deportation machine is abusing families and children in shockingly cruel ways. <a target="_blank" href="https://elizabethwarren.com/border-family-separation/">Elizabeth Warren</a> has a lengthy report on her visit to a McAllen, Texas Border Patrol facility where she was horrified by the treatment of incarcerated children. A report issued recently describes <a target="_blank" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a33042eb078691c386e7bce/t/5b3174e46d2a73f2d1f56aab/1529967847644/FFI_NatReportAbuse_062518.pdf">racially-motivated abuses of detainees in ICE facilities</a>, including the <strong>Bristol County House of Correction</strong>. Last week it was reported that the <strong>Boston Public Schools</strong> took it upon themselves to share data with ICE, and on the Cape high school students were reported to ICE by <strong>guidance counselors</strong> for supposed gang affiliations simply because they spoke Spanish. This insanity must end. Let police deal with real criminals and end vigilantism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protections for immigrant families in the 2019 budget prevent state officials from being used as federal agents. Only the Massachusetts Department of Corrections will be able to fulfill some of these federal immigration functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customs and Border Patrol is stopping vehicles on parts of I-93 and demanding that passengers produce proof of citizenship. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/13_08_01_aclu_100_mile_cbp_zone_final.pdf">Warrantless stops</a> with requests for “papers!” is creepy and totalitarian enough without state and local police being enlisted in violations of the Fourth Amendment. Even with the 100-mile border “loophole,” many of these stops are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/02/border-patrol-warrantless-searches-often-unconstitutional/">unconstitutional</a>. Let’s affirm that, at least in Massachusetts, a “nation of laws” requires warrants and probable cause to stop people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protections for immigrant families in the 2019 budget define strict rules under which police officers can ask about immigration status and require training on the law for all officers.</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/White%20Supremacy/read-yourself/">Read about these provisions yourself</a>. Despite malicious misinformation, these provisions do <strong>not</strong> prevent police from arresting real criminals. They <strong>do</strong> make Massachusetts a lot safer for everyone and strengthen Constitutional protections many of us can still remember once having.</p>
<p>Call your <a target="_blank" href="https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator">State House Representative</a> to ask them to support protections for immigrant families in the 2019 budget.</p>
