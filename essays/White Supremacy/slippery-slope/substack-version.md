Donald Trump's last-ditch campaign manager, [Steve Bannon](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/opinion/turn-on-the-hate-steve-bannon-at-the-white-house.html), head of Breitbart News which has become a lounge for racists and neo-Nazis, finally got the job done. But even before Bannon, Trump had surrounded himself with [Islamophobes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-islamophobia_us_5668a9d7e4b080eddf56e951), [racists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clinton-wasnt-wrong-about-the-deplorables-among-trumps-supporters/2016/09/12/93720264-7932-11e6-beac-57a4a412e93a_story.html) and [white supremacists](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-white-supremacist-sec-primary_us_56cf4437e4b0bf0dab31222f) and [he has continuously promised a Muslim Registry](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/20/donald-trump-would-certainly-and-absolutely-create-a-database-of-muslims/).

With Trump's [meeting yesterday with Peter King](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-king-muslim-surveillance-trump_us_5852fdcae4b0b3ddfd8bc377) to discuss a Muslim surveillance program, it is now even clearer that the incoming administration intends to proceed down this slippery slope.

And who knows what's next?

A few tech companies have said they'll [refuse to lend a willing hand](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/12/13/tech-workers-vow-not-build-trump-muslim-registry/95407242/) on such a project, but some have not.

There is a petition to urge other tech companies to follow the lead of Twitter, Microsoft, and Facebook:

And if you don't like the idea of Bannon in the White House, sign this one too:

<http://pac.petitions.moveon.org/sign/tell-trump-fire-steve>

Petitions may not accomplish much -- and all it takes is for one tech company to build the registry. But it's important to speak out against all the hate that is finding a home in the new administration.
