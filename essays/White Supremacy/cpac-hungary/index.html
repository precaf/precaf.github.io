<p>If you have been worrying about the white supremacy now
openly-displayed within Republican Party ranks, you’re not alone. Last
week the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (IREHR), a
research group that keeps an eye on America’s far right, issued a
report, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/">Breaching
the Mainstream</a>, listing 875 legislators (almost all Republicans)
with ties to nationalist groups or ones promoting conspiracy theories.
Don’t feel smug, Bay Staters — you’ll find a number of <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/appendix-a-legislator-membership-in-far-right-facebook-groups/">Massachusetts
Republicans</a> among them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the news just keeps getting worse.</p>
<p>Last week Republicans took one of their conservative political
conferences to Hungary — possibly the most anti-democratic Western
nation of all — and literally rubbed elbows with European fascists —
while only days before in Buffalo, New York a white supremacist tried to
launch a race war by slaughtering Black people as they went about their
grocery shopping.</p>
<p>On May 19-20, Hungary’s Center for Fundamental Rights <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cpachungary.com/en/program">hosted</a> the American
Conservative Union’s annual Conservative Political Action Conference
(CPAC) in Budapest. After prayers, of course, Hungary’s antisemitic
prime minister <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-anti-semitism-problem-hungary-jews/">Viktor
Orban</a> and American white supremacist commentator <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-descent-white-supremacy-timeline">Tucker
Carlson</a> joined the organizers in opening the event, which was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93bxm8/cpac-hungary-us-journalists-blocked">off-limits</a>
to U.S. reporters.</p>
<p>Viktor Orban’s party, Fidesz, the Hungarian Civic Alliance, began
life in 1988 as <em>Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége</em> (Alliance of Young
Democrats), a liberal center-left organization that rejected Hungary’s
ruling Communist government. Its members were quickly joined by
Hungary’s far right. In 1994 an unlikely mix of centrists and far-right
elements led Fidesz to adopt “liberal-conservativism,” driving real
liberals out of the party. Within less than a decade Fidesz became a
nationalist, then a <em>hyper</em>-nationalist, then an authoritarian
party riddled with neo-fascists, antisemites, and open racists. Orban
has been Hungary’s president for four terms now.</p>
<p>Orban set about stomping on all vestiges of the liberal order. He did
everything possible to smear fellow Hungarian <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/04/04/four-more-years-hungarys-orban-declares-victory-over-international-left-soros-empire-mainstream-media/">George
Soros</a> as both a “globalist” and a Jew, and to drive Soros’s liberal
philanthropies out of Hungary. So normalized is antisemitism now within
Fidesz that Day Two of the conference featured a close friend of
Orban’s, Hungarian writer <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/328093">Zsolt Bayer</a>,
who has calls Jews “stinking excrement” and the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/notorious-hungarian-racist-who-called-jews-stinking-excrement-speaks-at-cpac/">Roma</a>
“unfit for coexistence.” Bayer has also not been shy in voicing his <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/trump-shares-cpac-hungary-platform-racist-antisemite">contempt</a>
for Black people.</p>
<p>After coffee the program proceeded with: former U.S. Senator <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-fired-rick-santorum-for-racist-pro-colonization-comments">Rick
Santorum</a>, fired from CNN for his homophobic, racist, and
pro-colonial comments; former Member of British Parliament <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/uk-news/58414/nigel-farage-branded-racist-and-fascist-his-teachers">Nigel
Farage</a>, an <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage">endorser</a> of
neo-Nazi parties in France, Austria, and Germany; <a
target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/8048d1a04b774256b52568dcaba6a07e">Eduardo
Bolsonaro</a>, the son of Brazil’s president, member of parliament,
curiously present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th; and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/ben-ferguson">Ben Ferguson</a>, who
broadcasts racist, homophobic, and nationalist bile from a home
studio.</p>
<p>Quite the group to set the tone.</p>
<p>For the last 45 years the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/26/cpac-helped-launch-reagan-era-maintains-influence/4566369001/">CPAC
conference</a> has shaped the direction that American conservatism
takes. CPAC was the launchpad for Reagan-style politics after Watergate
and CPAC still defines the path of the American Republican Party. It is
significant, then, that CPAC now promotes Hungary — a state <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dw.com/en/hungary-is-no-longer-a-democracy-says-hungarian-legal-scholar/a-53442394">no
longer a democracy</a> and one with less <a
target="_blank" href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores?sort=desc&amp;order=Total%20Score%20and%20Status">freedom</a>
than even Brazil — as the Republican Party’s model for America’s
future.</p>
<p>After lunch, the program turned to “Western Civilization under
Attack.” The themes were indistinguishable from those of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/payton-gendron-buffalo-shooting-suspect-what-we-know/index.html">Buffalo,
NY shooter</a>, who in a long <a
target="_blank" href="https://app.box.com/s/ae6b8jrxwzvpd9ctyico750mhfg8nc8p">manifesto</a>
had written that he feared low white birth rates, the “replacement” and
“genocide” of white people by inferior Blacks, and the invasion of
America by foreign migrants. Amid the shooter’s Great Replacement
worries, he leveled accusations of Jewish and globalist cultural
contamination and fears of the erosion of white Christian values. George
Soros was mentioned.</p>
<p>CPAC speakers in their “under Attack” session were: <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/balazs-orban-hungarian-conservatism/">Balazs
Orban</a>, a long-time friend of the American far-right; <a
target="_blank" href="https://europeanconservative.com/authors/francesco-giubilei/">Francesco
Giubilei</a>, writer and head of far-right think tank Nazione Futura,
which is close to far-right political party <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/meet-the-promising-new-leader-of-the-italian-right/">Fratelli
d’Italia</a> (Brothers of Italy); <a
target="_blank" href="https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-mark-krikorian/">Mark
Krikorian</a>, who heads the Center for Immigration Studies, an
anti-immigrant group created by white supremacist <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/john-tanton">John
Tanton</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frankfuredi.com/">Frank Furedi</a>, a
Hungarian-British sociologist who rants about “woke” identity politics;
and <a target="_blank" href="https://equityfwd.org/valerie-huber">Valerie Huber</a>, an
American anti-abortion and pro-abstinence zealot. Their topics were
stopping abortion, promoting Christian values (over corrupt, “woke”
globalists) and preventing invasions of migrants. It goes without saying
that many of the speakers were antisemites. And, of course George Soros
was mentioned.</p>
<p>Long before the Buffalo shooter invoked the Great Replacement theory,
Viktor Orban enunciated it at his fourth <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/cpac-conference-budapest-hungary-viktor-orban-speaker">inauguration</a>:
“I see the great European population exchange as a suicidal attempt to
replace the lack of European, Christian children with adults from other
civilizations — migrants.”</p>
<p>At the Budapest conference <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb7ad/cpac-head-promotes-abortion-ban-to-stave-off-great-replacement">Matt
Schlapp</a>, chairman of the American Conservative Union which produces
CPAC each year, not only connected Orban’s views on “replacement” with
the shooter’s but explained why ending abortion rights was such an
important goal of white nationalists: “If you say there is a population
problem in a country, but you’re killing millions of your own people
through legalized abortion every year, if that were to be reduced, some
of that problem is solved. […] You have millions of people who can take
many of these jobs. How come no one brings that up? If you’re worried
about this quote-unquote replacement, why don’t we start there? Start
with allowing our own people to live.”</p>
<p>In a segment called “In God We Trust” the conference pushed white
Christian Nationalism masquerading as self-determination. Cynically, or
perhaps strategically, CPAC chose an Israeli speaker, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/get-over-itisrael-is-the-jewish-state/news-story/e1370cd9ee1d627cf3a83a53f677eb3d">Eugene
Kontorovich</a>, who shills for a number of right-wing think tanks
including the Hoover Institute, to defend Christian Nationalism for all
the same reasons he supports Zionism: national self-determination. By
Kontorovich’s logic, if 51% of a nation’s citizens are Catholics, Jews,
Muslims, or Buddhists, everyone else must be forced to live according to
the majority’s belief system.</p>
<p>“Culture Wars in the Media” was up next, featuring, among others: <a
target="_blank" href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/why-did-hungarys-strongman-hire-an-american-strong-man">David
Reaboi</a> of the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb4y3/john-eastman-claremont-institute-supporting-jan-6-trumpism">Claremont

Tyrmand</a> from Project Veritas (permanently suspended by Twitter) who
is also involved in the “paleoconservative” journal <a
target="_blank" href="https://chroniclesmagazine.org/interview/an-interview-with-matthew-tyrmand/">Chronicles</a>
magazine; and <a
target="_blank" href="https://marketrealist.com/p/who-is-the-ceo-of-parler/">George
Farmer</a>, CEO of Parler (whose app was suspended by Apple and Google)
and husband of moon-landing and COVID denier <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/candace-owens-zelensky-bad-character-ukraine-1689214">Candace
Owens</a>. Hungarian news anchor <a
target="_blank" href="https://edmo.eu/2022/04/05/ukrainian-refugees-and-disinformation-situation-in-poland-hungary-slovakia-and-romania/">Balazs
Nemeth</a>, who shares Orban’s views of the Ukraine as Hungary’s enemy,
discussed fake news in the globalist media.</p>
<p>The following morning’s theme was “The Father is a Man, the Mother is
a Woman.” Candace Owens was introduced as “the favorite influencer of
Donald Trump.” Antisemite <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/328093">Zsolt Bayer</a>
did his thing. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.eurotopics.net/en/181606/toercsi-peter">Péter
Törcsi</a>, who wrote “the Gay lobby has society firmly in its
clutches,” also spoke. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.merkur.de/politik/bestseller-autorin-birgit-kelle-irre-gender-wahn-gender-gaga-zr-4790683.html">Birgit
Kelle</a>, the author of <em>Gender Gaga</em>, discussed the topics of
her book: the ills of hiring quotas for women, liberal relaxations of
binary concepts of gender, toilets for trans teens, and liberals whose
goal is “the destruction of the family.” <a
target="_blank" href="https://aclj.org/writers/gregor-puppinck">Gregor Puppinck</a>, a
lawyer who has written numerous attacks on George Soros as well as
disputations of democratic rights, particularly abortion as a right, led
with abortion. <a
target="_blank" href="https://hungarianspectrum.org/tag/andrea-foldi-kovacs/">Andrea
Földi-Kovács</a>, who survived Orban’s purge of liberal Hungarian TV
anchors, frequently <a
target="_blank" href="https://conservatives.global/human-life-is-not-a-matter-of-opinion/">slams
abortion</a> in her pieces.</p>
<p>Ending the program was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/in-defense-of-cultural-christianity/">Gladen
Pappin</a>, who has written that “deracinated, gnostic deformations of
Christianity […] can’t sustain a true cultural Christianity, precisely
because both the ‘Christianity’ and the culture it engenders are
immaterial, disembodied, individualistic — which is to say, perfectly
suited to liberal order.”</p>
<p>Forget sissified liberal Christianity; what’s <em>really</em> needed
is a muscular, authoritarian-approved version of Christianity stuffed
down everybody’s throat — but, of course, for their own good: “It is
time for American conservatives to grasp what their European
counterparts already know. The deep wellsprings of Christian culture
offer a permanent source upon which good government can draw, so that,
as the psalmist sings, ‘we may know thy way upon earth: thy salvation in
all nations.’”</p>
<p>In fact, American conservatives ought to know what European liberals
already know — that fascism hasn’t been particularly good for
Europe.</p>
<p>After coffee the theme turned to “Conservative Revival” with talks
by: <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319/index.html">Mark
Meadows</a>, Trump’s disgraced Chief of Staff; <a
target="_blank" href="https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/chiles-fascist-ultra-right/">Rojo
Edwards</a>, an American-born Chilean fascist; Spanish fascists <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.elespanol.com/eldigitalcastillalamancha/region/20211214/acusan-politico-vox-apologia-fascismo-visita-toledo/634686650_0.html">Jorge
Buxade</a> and <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/abascal-the-far-right-leader-fighting-the-traitors-of-spain/">Santiago
Abascal</a>, from the Vox party; and an authoritarian roundtable.</p>
<p>After lunch the theme was “Homeland, Security.” <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.terrorhaza.hu/en/news/maria-schmidt-trumps-personality-may-be-inspiring-for-europe">Maria
Schmidt</a>, historian and former Orban advisor, frequently <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.democracyculturefoundation.org/who-we-are/leadership-council/maria-schmidt/">writes</a>
about the dangers of socialism. Next up was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/american-conservatism-is-fiddling-while-rome-burns/">David
Azerrad</a>, who worries too much about changing demographics and who
teaches at Hillsdale College, a private Christian college that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/education/2021/07/21/hillsdale-college-fight-critical-race-theory-free-k-12-history-curriculum/">fights</a>
“Critical Race Theory.” As one might expect, Azerrad was not received
well when he delivered a speech entitled “Black Privilege and Racial
Hysteria” at <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/saint-vincent-college-receives-backlash-after-hosting-controversial-guest-speaker/ERMOERHB45AEDN7RFDLYRPAWRE/">Saint
Vincent College</a>. Then there was <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/members/chris-farrell/">Chris
Farrell</a>, director of Judicial Watch and a member of the
Muslim-bashing <a
target="_blank" href="https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-gatestone-institute/">Gatestone
Institute</a>. He was followed by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594030618/centerforimmigra">John
Fund</a>, an anti-immigration zealot who claims that undocumented
immigrants risk everything to vote illegally. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/james-wharton-tory-mp-party-whip-lords-b1796274.html">James
Wharton</a>, a member of the British Conservative Party and the House of

Orban.</p>
<p>Finishing up the day was “CPACS All Around the World.” The CPAC
conference in Hungary was the American Conservative Union’s first stop
in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.conservative.org/events/">series</a> of
international conferences that include Brazil (June 10-11), Mexico
(September 2-3), Australia (October 1-2), Japan (December), and South
Korea (TBA). Several speakers talked about plans and opportunities in
these countries.</p>
<p>The American far right has long had a white Christian nationalist
“internationale” in mind. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/steve-bannon-far-right-radicalise-europe-trump">Steve
Bannon</a> may be the poster boy for such efforts, having spent the last

and creating curriculum for the <em>Dignitatis Humanae</em> Institute,
an “academy for the Judeo-Christian West” in an Italian monastery, <a

with German neo-Nazis, hanging out with the <a

and other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077269/">Boys from

target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/austrias-far-right-unwilling-to-collaborate-with-bannon/">Austrian</a>
neo-Nazis spurned him. But CPAC’s international conferences, organized
by what are now <em>mainstream</em> Republicans, may gain better
traction.</p>
<p>Ending the conference were speeches by <a

<p>Hannah Arendt, in her <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/396931.The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism">masterful</a>
“Origins of Totalitarianism” described perfectly the function of
organizations like CPAC: “The world at large […] usually gets its first
glimpse of a totalitarian movement through its front organizations. The
sympathizers, who are to all appearances still innocuous fellow-citizens
in a nontotalitarian society, can hardly be called single-minded
fanatics; through them, the movements make their fantastic lies more
generally acceptable, can spread their propaganda in milder, more
respectable forms, until the whole atmosphere is poisoned with
totalitarian elements which are hardly recognizable as such but appear
to be normal political reactions or opinions.”</p>
<p>This is the future of the Republican Party. And if the GOP gains
power in the Fall this could also be the dark future of the United
States.</p>
