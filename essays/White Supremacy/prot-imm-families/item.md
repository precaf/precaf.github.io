As promised, I'm sending you the **Action Alert** I promised last week. 

With hope fading for protections for our immigrant neighbors, sitting around doing nothing is *not* an option. There are several key pieces of Safe Communities legislation that can still make it into the 2019 state budget as [amendments](https://malegislature.gov/Budget/FY2019/SenateDebate). These provisions have broad public support and give critical protections to  all immigrants, regardless of status. 

Sen. Jamie Eldridge, sponsor of the Safe Communities Act, has filed an amendment advancing four key protections from the bill. His amendment has a good chance of succeeding but we need to get as many Senators as possible to endorse it — and be ready to fight for it.

The "ask" from Senators is simple — **take a stand for immigrant families in the Commonwealth** by co-sponsoring Senator Eldridge’s amendment #1147. We also want Senators to **oppose** Senator Fattman’s amendment #1136, which would allow police to detain people for federal immigration authorities.

We are also asking for support for Senator Eldridge’s amendment #176, to boost funding for adult basic education and English classes from \$31 million to \$34.5 million, and Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr's amendment #658, to boost funding for the Citizenship for New Americans (CNAP) program from \$400,000 to \$500,000. Not only should we encourage eligible immigrants to become U.S. citizens — we should provide adequate program funding.

**Call your Senator**:

First, [find your Massachusetts state Senator](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator).

> Hello, my name is __________ and I live in [city or town]. I am calling to urge Senator [name] to take a stand for immigrant families by co-sponsoring Senator Eldridge’s amendment #1147. I urge the Senator to advocate with Senate leadership, and vote for the amendment when it comes to the floor. I also support amendment #176 to boost funding for ESL programs, and amendment #658 to boost funding for the CNAP program. In addition, the Senator should OPPOSE Sen. Fattman’s amendment #1136, which would end protections gained under the Lunn decision. Massachusetts should be taking the lead in protecting immigrant families. Anything less in the Trump era is unacceptable. Thank you for taking my call!

**Call the Senate Leadership**:

You can reach Senate President Harriette Chandler at [617-722-1500](tel:617-722-1500) and Senate Ways & Means Chairwoman Karen Spilka at [617-722-1640](tel:617-722-1640). The message for them: 

> Hello, my name is __________ and I live in [city or town]. I am calling to urge President Chandler / Chairwoman Spilka to take a stand for immigrant families by supporting Senator Eldridge’s amendment #1147 and OPPOSING Sen. Fattman’s amendment #1136, which would end the protections we won under the Lunn decision. I also urge support for amendment #176 to boost funding for ESL programs, and amendment #658 to boost funding for the CNAP program. Massachusetts should be taking the lead in protecting immigrant families. Anything less in the Trump era is unacceptable. Thank you for taking my call!
