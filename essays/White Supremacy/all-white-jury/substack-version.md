The U.S. Senate consists of 100 senators, 67 of whom must vote to convict Donald Trump of crimes he committed while in office. There are a few Republicans who think that fomenting a coup which almost cost the lives of fellow representatives and senators in the Capitol on January 6th was a criminal act. And you might think that the Senate trial ought to be a slam-dunk, especially given the weak defense Donald Trump's lawyers have mounted.

But like most things in America, a lot of it is about race.

Our nation's founders not only feared black demographics but the general citizenry itself. It wasn't until the 20th Century that a citizen even got to vote for his own senator. Until the Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, senators were appointed by the governor of each state and often *that* position was hereditary. It wasn't until 1920 until women could vote at all.

By design, then, the U.S. Senate has always been the Yankee version of the House of Lords. By design it was and remains undemocratic, and by design its purpose is to thwart the will of the people's House of Representatives. It does this a little too well, and democracy has always been the victim.

Also by design, the Senate remains an overwhelmingly white club. Of the nation's 100 senators, roughly 90% are white — a statistical anomaly in a country where only 76% of the population is white and the percentage has been declining since 1950.

All of which is to say — this is the lily white jury that's going to consider Trump's Articles of Impeachment. The same people that acquited him the last time.

Donald Trump once boasted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and wouldn't lose a vote. A Department of Justice memorandum gave him a get-out-of-jail-free card for federal offenses while in office. And the composition of the Senate makes it virtually certain that Trump's impeachable offenses will result in acquittal even as the DOJ memorandum no longer applies.

Trump's *previous* Articles of Impeachment were watered-down charges consisting only of the President's most *recent* attempts to extort Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 presidential election. Those charges never included *anything* from the Mueller report, Trump's numerous emoluments clause violations, lying about illegal payments to porn stars and mistresses, or any of his many obstructions of justice. And now Trump is being charged with calling for a rebellion intended to stop the counting of Electoral College votes.

The travesty of justice we are about to witness in the U.S. Senate is one America has seen many times before. It's a repeat of the exculpation of murderous criminals by all-white juries, if they were ever charged, from the beginnings of American history.

-   In 1955, when Emmett Till was murdered and his body thrown into the Tallahatchie River, his killers were acquitted by an all-white jury after one hour of deliberation.

-   In 1963, after Medgar Evers was gunned down in Mississippi, two all-white juries acquitted his killers in separate trials.

-   In 1998, when 13 white supremacists were charged with attempting to murder a federal judge and FBI agent, they were acquitted by an all-white jury.

-   In 2013, George Zimmerman was found not guilty of the murder of Trayvon Martin by a jury with only one juror of color.

-   In 2016, a group of armed sovereign citizens who occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were acquitted by an all-white jury — while on the same day unarmed Native Americans protesting a pipeline on their own land were maced and beaten by police.

-   It's not even possible to list the thousands of times that white police officers have murdered unarmed black men and been acquitted or simply not charged.

As Trump's impeachment ends, Democrats will fume about a partisan Senate subverting justice by acquitting the most treasonous act any president has ever committed.

But it's a travesty of justice that people of color in the United States know only too well.
