The nation can't take much more of this. This week *alone* Donald Trump has edged us uncomfortably closer to both nuclear and civil war.

Anyone disappointed by Trump's unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and fascists should hardly be surprised. Anyone who believes the GOP's repudiations of white supremacy should remember how hard Republicans fought for Trump's cabinet picks and national security appointments (below). And anyone who would like to give the 45th president of the United State the benefit of the doubt on his recent comments should remember that [white supremacy is a tradition in the Trump family](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/charlottesville-latest-donald-trump-father-fred-arrested-ku-klux-klan-kkk-rally-riot-queens-new-york-a7891701.html).

Trump has got to go. Either by impeachment or the 25th Amendment, either is fine by me. And those in the following gallery of haters -- half of whom are Trump-appointed white supremacists -- should all be shown the door.
