Donald Trumpâ€™s Executive Orders are causing a lot of fear and insecurity in New Bedford's immigrant community, resulting in a dramatic increase in demand for the [Immigrants' Assistance Center's](http://www.immigrantsassistancecenter.org/) (IAC) services. Now more than ever **the IAC needs your support**.

\* \* \*

The IAC will be hosting another **community forum** on Saturday, February 25th, 10-12am, at 58 Crapo Street in New Bedford. The purpose will be to give the immigrant community an overview of the impact of the Trump presidency. Come and learn about rights and risks.

Next month, on March 31, 2017 from 6pm-10pm, the IAC will be hosting a **fundraiser** at the New Bedford Whaling Museum's Harbor View Room at 18 Johnny Cake Hill, New Bedford. Tickets are $50 per person.

Download the [fundraising letter](IAC-fundraiser.pdf) here.

Don't stop with that fundraising ticket. If you can spare the cash, support the IAC generously with a bigger donation. **They are going to need more resources than any of us can imagine right now**.
