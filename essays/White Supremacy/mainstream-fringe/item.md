![Trump and Friends](angry-whites.png)

It has [not gone unnoticed](http://popularresistance.org/white-supremacists-in-suits-and-ties-in-washington/) that Donald Trump's election day shocker was due largely to support from the so-called "[Alt-Right](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/opinion/donald-trumps-alt-right-brain.html)" -- a catchy new euphemism for [white supremacy](http://www.salon.com/2014/09/03/before_ferguson_americas_disturbing_legacy_of_white_supremacy_and_guns/) and [Hitler salutes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/11/21/d-c-restaurant-apologizes-after-hosting-alt-right-dinner-with-sieg-heil-salute/). But less conspicuously, even "mainstream" Republicans have been cozying up to white supremacy lately.  And in general, the political landscape has [shifted sharply to the far right in the last two years](http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/09/06/the-25-most-influential-people-on-the-right-for-2014-n1888129).

Mainstream conservatives are embracing the fringe.

<u>The National Review</u>

The [National Review](http://newrepublic.com/article/128176/national-review-fails-kill-monster), which was founded by William F. Buckley in 1955, has struggled with and repeatedly purged itself of white supremacists but seems to be [losing the battle](http://fair.org/uncategorized/national-review-just-cant-seem-to-shake-its-racist-image/). The magazine has had to [fire John Derbyshire](http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/04/national-review-fires-john-derbyshire-119887), who had a little [racist sideline](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/john-derbyshire-fired-article-african-americans) on Taki's Magazine, where [Richard Spencer](http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0) was once an editor; [John O'Sullivan](http://www.salon.com/2012/04/17/another_national_review_contributor_pals_around_with_nativists/), another NR writer who was on the boards of both VDARE and the Lexington Research Institute; [Peter Brimelow](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/people/peter-brimelow/), NR writer and former editor at Forbes, [and a writer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brimelow#cite_note-4) for Barron's, Fortune, and the Wall Street Journal.

William F. Buckley [devoted much of his time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.) to weeding segregationists, "Birchers," anti-Semites, and the lunatic fringe from the pages of the National Review. After he died in 2008 the garden he planted was overrun with weeds.

This week's *National Review*, for example, has long-time NRO editor [George Will defending Jeff Sessions](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443299/civil-forfeiture-property-seizure-no-judicial-process-jeff-sesions-justice-department), a KKK apologist [too racist to be appointed as a federal judge](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-racist-remarks_us_582cd73ae4b099512f80c0c2) but who may now be the Attorney General. Alongside this is a piece by forrmer NR [editor](http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/06/charles-w-cooke-named-national-review-online-editor-224428) Charles C.W. Cooke, who penned "[Teach Holocaust Denial and be Proud of It](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/377438/teach-holocaust-denial-and-be-proud-it-charles-c-w-cooke)." And right next to *that* is a piece by Andrew C. McCarthy [blasting Obama's refusal to veto a UN resolution](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443327/united-nations-israel-settlements-resolution-barack-obama-betrayal-israel) on illegal Israeli settlements. [McCarthy is also the author of a book promoting the conspiracy theory](http://www.amazon.com/Embraces-Islams-Sharia-Encounter-Broadsides-ebook/dp/B004DUMW5E) that Obama is trying to bring Shariah law to the United States.

<u>The Heritage Foundation+</u>

The [Heritage Foundation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/08/heritage-study-co-author-opposed-letting-in-immigrants-with-low-iqs/), whose opinion-shapers appear regularly in newspapers, has also been afflicted with the virus. Jason Richwine is the most notorious of these, [penning a number of articles](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/09/1208068/-Heritage-s-in-house-white-supremacist-wrote-for-white-supremacists) on blacks and Hispanics on alternativeright.com. President-elect Trump's White House advisor Steve [Bannon praised Richwine](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2016/11/18/bannon-lavishes-praise-on-guy-too-racist-for-the-heritage-foundation/) on his [Sirius XM radio](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/top-trump-adviser-steve-bannon-cited-racist-anti-immigrant-book-in-radio-appearance/) show. The Heritage Foundation wraps its white supremacy in "scientific studies," like the one Richwine wrote that blasted immigration reform, claiming illegal immigrants would [suck $9.4 trillion of benefits](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/05/the-fiscal-cost-of-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-to-the-us-taxpayer) from upstanding white Americans -- which [one writer joked](http://wonkette.com/515283/heritage-foundation-immigration-reform-will-bankrupt-entire-solar-system) "will bankrupt the solar system."

Besides racism, the Heritage Foundation also promotes Islamophobia. A 2014 [panel the Heritage Foundation organized](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-heritages-ugly-benghazi-panel/2014/06/16/b8bd423c-f5a3-11e3-a606-946fd632f9f1_story.html) to draw attention to the Benghazi controversy soon devolved into a mudslinging match accusing President Obama of funding jihadist violence and promoting Shariah law. The Heritage Foundation had invited Brigitte Gabriel from ACT, which the Council on American-Islamic Relations has identifed as part of a well-funded [Islamophobia Network](http://islamophobianetwork.com/echo-chamber/brigitte-gabriel). The panel was led by Chris Plante, a rightwing talk show host, who turned the discussion into an "Islamophobic freak show," as [Salon described](http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/heritage_foundation_benghazi_panel_descends_into_islamophobic_freak_show/) it, and included [Frank Gaffney](http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/frank-gaffney-jr), one of the fringiest of the fringe. The panel featured the trio attacking a Muslim student who rose to speak and demanding to know her nationality (it was "United States citizen").

The Heritage Foundation's president is [Jim DeMint](http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/d/jim-demint), a former U.S. Senator from South Carolina turned Tea Party leader, and "the most hated man in Washington" [by one account](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/jim-demint-the-most-hated-man-in-washington-104209). Under DeMint's leadership the Heritage Foundation has [lost credibility and clout](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/10/21/jim-demints-destruction-of-the-heritage-foundation/). As Senator, DeMint was a divisive politician who went out of his way to [greet a racist rally](http://thinkprogress.org/radical-racist-signs-featured-at-9-12-march-1f8e7f807cca#.5u7xwcvhy), a move that fellow Republicans slammed, with one warning that "freaks fill the void and define the party." Call it an "unguarded moment" or a Freudian slip, but DeMint admitted that the [purpose of disenfranchising blacks through Voter ID](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/jim-demint-voter-id-helps-elect-more-conservative-candidates/) laws was to elect "more conservatives."

It is not surprising that the Heritage Foundation was founded by [Richard Mellon Scaife](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/us/richard-mellon-scaife-influential-us-conservative-dies-at-82.html?_r=4), who died recently. An heir to the Mellon fortune, Scaife set up a network of [rightwing foundations](http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Scaife_Foundations/) and [Islamophobic](http://www.islamophobia.org/islamophobic-orgs/sarah-scaife-foundation.html) organizations. In the good old days, billionaires dabbled in art. Now they support hate groups.

(Dear newspaper editors -- if you're reading this -- stop publishing garbage from the Heritage Foundation!)

<u>Other mentions</u>

No one could have imagined Ann Coulter's fulminations could get any worse but now [she is attending VDARE's white supremacy conferences](http://www.salon.com/2016/12/23/ann-coulters-white-christmas-vdare-holiday-bash-is-her-second-white-nationalist-event-this-quarter/). We always thought Ann was just a fact-challenged *provocatuese* but now we know better.

The [American Conservative Union](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/03/white-nationalist-work-featured-conservative-conference-organizers), which runs the CPAC conference all Republican candidates are expected to attend, is another nexus of white supremacists and Klan admirers. 

The [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://donate.splcenter.org/splcdonate) keeps tabs on all these homegrown Nazis -- and it's not like they didn't warn us. [The NAACP as well](http://naacp.3cdn.net/36b2014e1dddfe3c81_v7m6bls07.pdf) reported six years ago on the Tea Party's deep ties to white supremacist groups and extremist militias.

<u>Paleoconservatism and Trump</u>

Before the Alt-Right there were the [Paleoconservatives](http://www.conservapedia.com/Paleoconservative) -- anti-Semites and isolationist Eurocentric nationalists. [Pat Buchanan](http://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/04/29/pat-buchanan-pens-exclusive-anti-semitic-publication), who was an advisor to both Nixon and Reagan, has written for Holocaust denying publications and cited the American Nazi Party's [William Pierce](http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/citing-neo-nazi-and-racist-sources-buchanan-sounds-alarm) in one of his books. Over time paleoconservatives fell out of favor for their isolationism and were banished to the fringes where they became a natural magnet for the extreme right.

[Stephen Mihm writing in Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-27/paleoconservatism-is-back) makes a good argument for Trump's paleoconservatism. And [Dylan Matthews writing in Vox](http://www.vox.com/2016/5/6/11592604/donald-trump-paleoconservative-buchanan) suggests that Donald Trump is not merely an opportunist manipulated by the Alt-Right but an "imperfect Paleoconservative" himself. Both articles should dispel the image of Trump as a mere showman. Trump (like [his father](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/28/in-1927-donald-trumps-father-was-arrested-after-a-klan-riot-in-queens/) before him) has been at home in [his white, white world](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/15/doj-trump-s-early-businesses-blocked-blacks.html) a long time.

Sixteen years ago, [William F. Buckley had this to say about the next President](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430187/william-f-buckley-jr-donald-trumps-demagoguery-cigar-aficionado-essay) of the United States:

> What about the aspirant who has a private vision to offer to the public and has the means, personal or contrived, to finance a campaign? In some cases, the vision isn’t merely a program to be adopted. It is a program that includes the visionary’s serving as President. Look for the narcissist. The most obvious target in today’s lineup is, of course, Donald Trump. When he looks at a glass, he is mesmerized by its reflection. If Donald Trump were shaped a little differently, he would compete for Miss America. But whatever the depths of self-enchantment, the demagogue has to say something. So what does Trump say? That he is a successful businessman and that that is what America needs in the Oval Office. There is some plausibility in this, though not much. The greatest deeds of American Presidents — midwifing the new republic; freeing the slaves; harnessing the energies and vision needed to win the Cold War — had little to do with a bottom line.

Today the magazine Buckley founded is nothing but a mirror for Trump to gaze at himself adoringly.
