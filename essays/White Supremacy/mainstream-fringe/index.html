<p>It has <a target="_blank" href="http://popularresistance.org/white-supremacists-in-suits-and-ties-in-washington/">not gone unnoticed</a> that Donald Trump’s election day shocker was due largely to support from the so-called “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/opinion/donald-trumps-alt-right-brain.html">Alt-Right</a>” – a catchy new euphemism for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/03/before_ferguson_americas_disturbing_legacy_of_white_supremacy_and_guns/">white supremacy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/11/21/d-c-restaurant-apologizes-after-hosting-alt-right-dinner-with-sieg-heil-salute/">Hitler salutes</a>. But less conspicuously, even “mainstream” Republicans have been cozying up to white supremacy lately. And in general, the political landscape has <a target="_blank" href="http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/09/06/the-25-most-influential-people-on-the-right-for-2014-n1888129">shifted sharply to the far right in the last two years</a>.</p>
<p>Mainstream conservatives are embracing the fringe.</p>
<p><u>The National Review</u></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://newrepublic.com/article/128176/national-review-fails-kill-monster">National Review</a>, which was founded by William F. Buckley in 1955, has struggled with and repeatedly purged itself of white supremacists but seems to be <a target="_blank" href="http://fair.org/uncategorized/national-review-just-cant-seem-to-shake-its-racist-image/">losing the battle</a>. The magazine has had to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/04/national-review-fires-john-derbyshire-119887">fire John Derbyshire</a>, who had a little <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/john-derbyshire-fired-article-african-americans">racist sideline</a> on Taki’s Magazine, where <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0">Richard Spencer</a> was once an editor; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/2012/04/17/another_national_review_contributor_pals_around_with_nativists/">John O’Sullivan</a>, another NR writer who was on the boards of both VDARE and the Lexington Research Institute; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/people/peter-brimelow/">Peter Brimelow</a>, NR writer and former editor at Forbes, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brimelow#cite_note-4">and a writer</a> for Barron’s, Fortune, and the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>William F. Buckley <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.">devoted much of his time</a> to weeding segregationists, “Birchers,” anti-Semites, and the lunatic fringe from the pages of the National Review. After he died in 2008 the garden he planted was overrun with weeds.</p>
<p>This week’s <em>National Review</em>, for example, has long-time NRO editor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443299/civil-forfeiture-property-seizure-no-judicial-process-jeff-sesions-justice-department">George Will defending Jeff Sessions</a>, a KKK apologist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-racist-remarks_us_582cd73ae4b099512f80c0c2">too racist to be appointed as a federal judge</a> but who may now be the Attorney General. Alongside this is a piece by forrmer NR <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/06/charles-w-cooke-named-national-review-online-editor-224428">editor</a> Charles C.W. Cooke, who penned “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/377438/teach-holocaust-denial-and-be-proud-it-charles-c-w-cooke">Teach Holocaust Denial and be Proud of It</a>.” And right next to <em>that</em> is a piece by Andrew C. McCarthy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443327/united-nations-israel-settlements-resolution-barack-obama-betrayal-israel">blasting Obama’s refusal to veto a UN resolution</a> on illegal Israeli settlements. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Embraces-Islams-Sharia-Encounter-Broadsides-ebook/dp/B004DUMW5E">McCarthy is also the author of a book promoting the conspiracy theory</a> that Obama is trying to bring Shariah law to the United States.</p>
<p><u>The Heritage Foundation+</u></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/08/heritage-study-co-author-opposed-letting-in-immigrants-with-low-iqs/">Heritage Foundation</a>, whose opinion-shapers appear regularly in newspapers, has also been afflicted with the virus. Jason Richwine is the most notorious of these, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/09/1208068/-Heritage-s-in-house-white-supremacist-wrote-for-white-supremacists">penning a number of articles</a> on blacks and Hispanics on alternativeright.com. President-elect Trump’s White House advisor Steve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2016/11/18/bannon-lavishes-praise-on-guy-too-racist-for-the-heritage-foundation/">Bannon praised Richwine</a> on his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/top-trump-adviser-steve-bannon-cited-racist-anti-immigrant-book-in-radio-appearance/">Sirius XM radio</a> show. The Heritage Foundation wraps its white supremacy in “scientific studies,” like the one Richwine wrote that blasted immigration reform, claiming illegal immigrants would <a target="_blank" href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/05/the-fiscal-cost-of-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-to-the-us-taxpayer">suck $9.4 trillion of benefits</a> from upstanding white Americans – which <a target="_blank" href="http://wonkette.com/515283/heritage-foundation-immigration-reform-will-bankrupt-entire-solar-system">one writer joked</a> “will bankrupt the solar system.”</p>
<p>Besides racism, the Heritage Foundation also promotes Islamophobia. A 2014 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-heritages-ugly-benghazi-panel/2014/06/16/b8bd423c-f5a3-11e3-a606-946fd632f9f1_story.html">panel the Heritage Foundation organized</a> to draw attention to the Benghazi controversy soon devolved into a mudslinging match accusing President Obama of funding jihadist violence and promoting Shariah law. The Heritage Foundation had invited Brigitte Gabriel from ACT, which the Council on American-Islamic Relations has identifed as part of a well-funded <a target="_blank" href="http://islamophobianetwork.com/echo-chamber/brigitte-gabriel">Islamophobia Network</a>. The panel was led by Chris Plante, a rightwing talk show host, who turned the discussion into an “Islamophobic freak show,” as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/heritage_foundation_benghazi_panel_descends_into_islamophobic_freak_show/">Salon described</a> it, and included <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/frank-gaffney-jr">Frank Gaffney</a>, one of the fringiest of the fringe. The panel featured the trio attacking a Muslim student who rose to speak and demanding to know her nationality (it was “United States citizen”).</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation’s president is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/d/jim-demint">Jim DeMint</a>, a former U.S. Senator from South Carolina turned Tea Party leader, and “the most hated man in Washington” <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/jim-demint-the-most-hated-man-in-washington-104209">by one account</a>. Under DeMint’s leadership the Heritage Foundation has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/10/21/jim-demints-destruction-of-the-heritage-foundation/">lost credibility and clout</a>. As Senator, DeMint was a divisive politician who went out of his way to <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkprogress.org/radical-racist-signs-featured-at-9-12-march-1f8e7f807cca#.5u7xwcvhy">greet a racist rally</a>, a move that fellow Republicans slammed, with one warning that “freaks fill the void and define the party.” Call it an “unguarded moment” or a Freudian slip, but DeMint admitted that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/jim-demint-voter-id-helps-elect-more-conservative-candidates/">purpose of disenfranchising blacks through Voter ID</a> laws was to elect “more conservatives.”</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the Heritage Foundation was founded by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/us/richard-mellon-scaife-influential-us-conservative-dies-at-82.html?_r=4">Richard Mellon Scaife</a>, who died recently. An heir to the Mellon fortune, Scaife set up a network of <a target="_blank" href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Scaife_Foundations/">rightwing foundations</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.islamophobia.org/islamophobic-orgs/sarah-scaife-foundation.html">Islamophobic</a> organizations. In the good old days, billionaires dabbled in art. Now they support hate groups.</p>

<p><u>Paleoconservatism and Trump</u></p>
<p>Before the Alt-Right there were the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Paleoconservative">Paleoconservatives</a> – anti-Semites and isolationist Eurocentric nationalists. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/04/29/pat-buchanan-pens-exclusive-anti-semitic-publication">Pat Buchanan</a>, who was an advisor to both Nixon and Reagan, has written for Holocaust denying publications and cited the American Nazi Party’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/citing-neo-nazi-and-racist-sources-buchanan-sounds-alarm">William Pierce</a> in one of his books. Over time paleoconservatives fell out of favor for their isolationism and were banished to the fringes where they became a natural magnet for the extreme right.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-27/paleoconservatism-is-back">Stephen Mihm writing in Bloomberg News</a> makes a good argument for Trump’s paleoconservatism. And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vox.com/2016/5/6/11592604/donald-trump-paleoconservative-buchanan">Dylan Matthews writing in Vox</a> suggests that Donald Trump is not merely an opportunist manipulated by the Alt-Right but an “imperfect Paleoconservative” himself. Both articles should dispel the image of Trump as a mere showman. Trump (like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/28/in-1927-donald-trumps-father-was-arrested-after-a-klan-riot-in-queens/">his father</a> before him) has been at home in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/15/doj-trump-s-early-businesses-blocked-blacks.html">his white, white world</a> a long time.</p>
<p>Sixteen years ago, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430187/william-f-buckley-jr-donald-trumps-demagoguery-cigar-aficionado-essay">William F. Buckley had this to say about the next President</a> of the United States:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about the aspirant who has a private vision to offer to the public and has the means, personal or contrived, to finance a campaign? In some cases, the vision isn’t merely a program to be adopted. It is a program that includes the visionary’s serving as President. Look for the narcissist. The most obvious target in today’s lineup is, of course, Donald Trump. When he looks at a glass, he is mesmerized by its reflection. If Donald Trump were shaped a little differently, he would compete for Miss America. But whatever the depths of self-enchantment, the demagogue has to say something. So what does Trump say? That he is a successful businessman and that that is what America needs in the Oval Office. There is some plausibility in this, though not much. The greatest deeds of American Presidents — midwifing the new republic; freeing the slaves; harnessing the energies and vision needed to win the Cold War — had little to do with a bottom line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today the magazine Buckley founded is nothing but a mirror for Trump to gaze at himself adoringly.</p>
