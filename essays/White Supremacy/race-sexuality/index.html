<p>Race and sexuality.</p>
<p>At first these two words seem to have no connection. But ask yourself
why both were woven into the racist “chivalry” that the Confederacy
cobbled together from Sir Walter Scott’s novels and tales of German
nobility — or why race and sexuality were invariably connected in
lynchings of Black men accused of talking to white women. Ask yourself
why — long after slavery, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow — there were
still laws on the books against miscegenation. Ask yourself why racial
purity and misogyny are so abundant in far-right groups.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself why men like Lindsay Graham and Ted Cruz were so
fixated upon and could so easily segue between race and sexuality when
they tried to put the first Black woman ever nominated to the Supreme
Court “in her place.”</p>
<p>Republicans, in their heart of hearts, their dream of dreams, relish
the power that white slave masters exercised over people who their slave
laws decreed were property — some whose wombs they made property through
sexual violence. Slave owners’ wives were property as well, and woe to a
woman who cast an admiring, or simply a kind, glance at a Black man.</p>
<p>Male white ownership and control of both race and sexuality was
implicit in slavery. The use of religion to establish the “proper place”
for both women and Blacks was also implicit. As a system of production
by slaves optimized by the production of more slaves, slavery had no use
for unproductive sex and relied on selective bible readings which
condemned homosexuality.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a scholar to read for yourself some of the
perversions of scripture Southern clergymen came up with to justify
slavery. Apologists for the “peculiar institution” were just as prolific
as abolitionists. Project Gutenberg has a great (and free) collection
you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/70">access
online</a>.</p>
<p>In one Gutenberg collection entitled “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28148/28148-h/28148-h.htm">Cotton
is King</a>” Mississippi clergyman E.N. Elliott defended slavery by
denying it had anything to do with ownership of human bodies; no, he
wrote, it involved a <em>relationship</em> established by God.</p>
<p>But many such defenses of slavery were equally bizarre or inhuman.
S.A. Cartwright MD, writing in the New Orleans Medical and Surgical
Journal, stated with absolute certainty that “the physiological fact
that negroes consume less oxygen indicates the superior wisdom of the
precepts [enslavement] taught in the Bible regarding <em>those
people.</em>”</p>
<p>As to beating slaves, “You hear of the poor negroes […] being beaten
with many stripes by their masters and overseers. But owing to the fact
that they consume less oxygen than white people, and the other physical
differences founded on difference of structure” … well, <em>they can
hardly feel it</em>, Cartwright concluded.</p>
<p>The denial of Black humanity was echoed by <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28148/28148-h/28148-h.htm">Chancellor
Harper</a> of South Carolina, who wrote, “Will those who regard slavery
as immoral, or crime in itself, tell us that man was not intended for
civilization, but to roam the earth as a <em>biped brute</em>?”</p>
<p>Intentionally or not, Harper spilled the beans on the <em>real</em>
reason that slavery existed — simple Capitalist greed. In fact, Marx
couldn’t have expressed it any better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Property—the accumulation of capital, as it is commonly called—is
the first element of civilization. But to accumulate, or to use capital
to any considerable extent, the combination of labor is necessary. In
early stages of society, when people are thinly scattered over an
extensive territory, the labor necessary to extensive works cannot be
commanded. Men are independent of each other. Having the command of
abundance of land, no one will submit to be employed in the service of
his neighbor. No one, therefore, can employ more capital than he can use
with his own hands, or those of his family, nor have an income much
beyond the necessaries of life. There can, therefore, be little leisure
for intellectual pursuits, or means of acquiring the comforts or
elegancies of life. It is hardly necessary to say, however, that if a
man has the command of slaves, he may combine labor, and use capital to
any required extent, and therefore accumulate wealth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. [of Theology] Anthea Butler, in her great little book “<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55815694-white-evangelical-racism">White
Evangelical Racism</a>,” describes the long history of misuse of
religion to justify slavery. She acknowledges the diversity and
complexity of white Evangelicals, noting that some later participated in
the Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>But when Republicans pushed their “Southern strategy” and wooed
formerly Democratic white Evangelicals with dog-whistles — if not overt
racist appeals — the seduction was too easy. Republicans were offering
white Evangelicals something they had long desired — political
power.</p>
<p>In an <a
target="_blank" href="https://religionandpolitics.org/2021/04/20/white-evangelical-racism-an-interview-with-anthea-butler/">interview</a>
with Religion &amp; Politics, Butler explained, “It’s not just that the
movement is led by a bunch of white guys. It’s that there is a cultural
whiteness at the heart of evangelicalism that anyone who enters the
community has to receive. I try to show, from Billy Graham onward, how
this inherent whiteness works, often by way of color blindness.
Officially, evangelicalism claims to be committed to a series of beliefs
and values that are higher than and so uninvested in questions of race,
and yet their political conservatism really seems to limit their
tolerance for non-white input, even from peers and leaders who share
their belief system.”</p>
<p>Butler links white paternalism in the home, on the plantation, and in
American foreign policy: “In the Reconstruction period, the ‘Religion of
the Lost Cause’ lamented the end of slavery and asserted that Black
people were inferior. The missionary movement asserted that foreigners
were ‘heathen’ in need of civilization, which was invariably couched in
white expressions of Christianity.”</p>
<p>As white Christian Nationalist assaults on secular society mount, it
is not surprising that almost all involve the twin Republican obsessions
of race and sexuality. Ground zero today is the nation’s schools, where
Republicans attack diversity curriculum and district efforts to make
schools safe and welcoming places for gay and trans students.</p>
<p>January 6th should have been a wake-up call, but we are failing to
take the threat that white Christian Nationalism poses to democracy
seriously. Within a generation the Republican Party has become an openly
proto-fascist political organization based on white Christian
Nationalism. Republican political institutions like CPAC openly flirt
with European fascists. Many of its members are white supremacists who
make no effort to conceal their neo-Confederate and neo-Nazi
sympathies.</p>
<p>And why should they? This is exactly what Republicans now stand
for.</p>
