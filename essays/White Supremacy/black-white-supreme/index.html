<p><em>White racists burning something: the common notion of white
supremacy</em></p>
<p>The gunman who opened fire with an AR-15 at a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/06/police-respond-to-shooting-in-dallas-mall">Dallas</a>
mall on May 6th, killing eight including numerous members of one Korean
family, was clearly targeting Asians. Perhaps it was the shooter’s name,
<em>Mauricio Garcia</em>, that confused Texas governor Greg Abbot, who
told reporters that the killer’s motivations were “unclear.” Within
hours, however, investigators had discovered the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2023/05/08/profile-apparently-linked-to-allen-gunman-shows-violence-obsession-admiration-of-hitler/">extent</a>
of Garcia’s white supremacist views and connections, which included
being an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2023/05/08/profile-apparently-linked-to-allen-gunman-shows-violence-obsession-admiration-of-hitler/">admirer
of Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>The very idea that a member of an ethnic or racial minority could be
a white supremacist continues to boggle the minds of far-right pundits.
Don Trump Jr. mockingly <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/don-jr-and-ann-coulter-mock-claim-that-texas-mall-shooter-had-nazi-links-–-because-hes-hispanic/ar-AA1aUdrP">posted</a>
on Truth Social, “Because the name Mauricio Garcia screams white
supremacy.” Elon Musk tweeted images of carnage from the shooting as
well as disinformation, including a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/05/11/gore-conspiracies-spread-on-elon-musks-loosely-moderated-twitter-after-allen-shooting/">conspiracy
theory</a> that a Hispanic white supremacist just had to be a “psyop.”
His speculation seemed to resonate with Musk’s far-right followers. When
NBA-to-Twitter personality <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rex-chapman-suggests-clarence-thomas-black-white-supremacist">Rex
Chapman</a> called Clarence Thomas a white supremacist, FOX News mocked
it as a typical liberal reaction to overturning Roe v. Wade (we will
return to Justice Thomas shortly).</p>
<p>So don’t you have to be white to be a white supremacist?</p>
<p>The far-right insists that we now live in a post-racial society free
of white supremacy and bias. Sure, there may still be a few overt haters
out there – <em>but not us!</em> Denial of racism is such an important
weapon of the far-right that now even <em>speaking</em> of America’s
history of racial crimes is itself a crime in numerous states.</p>
<p>References to slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, white-only water
fountains, lynchings, genocide of Native Americans, colonialism, racist
immigration laws, redlining, disparities in healthcare, life expectancy,
education, or generational wealth – all this is regarded as “divisive,”
intended only to make white school children feel bad about being white,
and therefore something to be censored.</p>
<p>Still, the far-right is equally clear that White Christian
Nationalism is their political platform. Republicans point to Hungarian
autocrat Viktor Orban’s regime as their <a
target="_blank" href="https://ehrens.substack.com/p/cpac-hungary">model</a> for a white,
Christian America. Former Congressman Steve King, an unrepentant white
supremacist, granted an <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iowa-rep-steve-king-austria-white-nationalist_n_5bca4851e4b0a8f17eec6001">interview</a>
with Austrian fascists. Former president Trump, now looking like the
leading GOP presidential candidate, has embraced neofascists in Italy,
France, and Brazil. Trump’s one-time campaign advisor Steve Bannon has
made the creation of a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/world/europe/bannon-vatican-julius-evola-fascism.html">fascist</a>
<em>Internationale</em> one of his projects.</p>
<p>In July 2022 <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/opinions/christian-nationalism-marjorie-taylor-greene-tyler/index.html">Marjorie
Taylor Greene</a> came out as an unapologetic Christian nationalist.
Ditto her moral and intellectual equal, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/opinions/christian-nationalism-marjorie-taylor-greene-tyler/index.html">Lauren
Boebert</a>, who told a group of white fundamentalists, “The church is
supposed to direct the government, the government is not supposed to
direct the church.” South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, once thought to be
a “moderate” Republican, echoed the sentiment, stating that government
ought to be “bowing the knee” to the church. And by “church” Scott does
not mean Buddhists, Jews, Muslims, Quakers, or once-mainstream Christian
denominations.</p>
<p>Just this week Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/11/tommy-tuberville-white-nationalism-comment-chuck-schumer/70209163007/">defended</a>
white nationalists in the military, calling them good Americans. This
recalls Trump’s characterization of the Tiki torch-bearing white
supremacists as “very fine people.”</p>
<p>Despite its obsession with white Anglo-Saxon “culture,” the dangers
of multiculturalism, the <a

Replacement</a> of white people by people of color, and its perverse,
nationalist conception of “Christianity,” White Christian Nationalism is
also increasingly being embraced by people of color.</p>

<p>It came as a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-memphis-residents-tyre-nichols-beating-black-officers-rcna67937">surprise
to no one</a> in Memphis’ Black community that the five officers who
beat Tyre Nichols to death were Black. Turns out, how Black police
officers approach policing is shaped by policies based on lingering
structural racism in law enforcement institutions. Again, white
supremacy is much more than overt hatred.</p>
<p>Such observations are nothing new. In the wake of the Dallas shooting
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/mauricio-garcia-white-supremacy/">Joan
Walsh</a> wrote an excellent piece in the Nation. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/5/8/2168277/-You-don-t-have-to-be-White-to-be-a-Neo-Nazi-White-Supremacist">Frank
Vyan Walton</a> published a short piece in the Daily Kos. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/08/texas-shooting-white-supremacy-non-whites/">Philip
Bump</a> offered an explanation in the Washington Post of why non-whites
embrace white supremacy.</p>
<p>One factor is self-identification with a dominant racial and ethnic
group. Increasingly, some non-white communities now identify as white.
Another is placing one’s self closer to the sources of political power.
Hispanic Americans now increasingly <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/10/rise-white-nationalist-hispanics-latinos">identify</a>
with white supremacy. And that <a
target="_blank" href="https://blackamericaweb.com/2023/05/09/hispanics-far-right-white-nationalists/">includes</a>
Mauricio Garcia, the Dallas shooter.</p>
<p>A new TV series “Beef” features two Asian characters acting out their
very “white” grievances with each other and America. In a piece in
Electric Lit <a
target="_blank" href="https://electricliterature.com/being-an-honorary-white-person-doesnt-make-us-more-powerful/">Frankie
Huang</a> dissects the two protagonists and their complicated
relationships with white society. He parenthetically blasts members of
his own community for cultural expropriation, exploiting “model
minority” status, and a lack of solidarity with other minorities – all
of which applies to every other ethnic group throughout American history
that has embraced “whiteness” by turning its back on egalitarian ideals
in order to stand nearer the sources of power and money.</p>
<p><img src="thomas.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Clarence chose his side and it pays pretty damn well</em></p>
<p>In an old article in the Nation, <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/enigma-clarence-thomas-book-review/">Randall
Kennedy</a> asks “Whose Side is Clarence Thomas On?” and proceeds easily
to a conclusion. Quoting Corey Robin, who has written a number of books
on far-right ideology, “Thomas has rationalized nearly all of his
efforts to maintain the legal architecture under which African Americans
have suffered most because ‘adversity helps the black community develop
its inner virtue and resolve.’ Robin adds, ‘It’s astonishing how openly
Thomas embraces not just federalism but a view of federalism associated
with the slaveocracy and Jim Crow.’”</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Thomas then, regardless of race, turns out to be the ideal Supreme
Court justice for the far right and its white supremacist agenda. In a
new PBS <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/clarence-ginni-thomas-docuseries-pbs-frontline">documentary</a>,
<em>Clarence and Ginni Thomas: Politics, Power and the Supreme
Court</em>, we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/">learn</a>
that Thomas has a whole list of his own grievances meshing improbably
with White America’s.</p>
<p>Add to this Thomas’s marriage to one of America’s most zealous
far-right activists and arguably a seditionist, as well as Thomas’s
selling himself to <em>Sugar Daddy</em> Harlan Crow, and it becomes
clear that white supremacy is not so much about spewing racial epithets
as the preservation and concentration of political and economic
power.</p>
<p>White supremacists of whatever race know <em>exactly</em> which side
they’re on.</p>
