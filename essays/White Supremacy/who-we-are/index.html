<p>It is Black History Month and there are a couple of streamed
documentaries I heartily recommend: Jeffery Robinson’s <a
target="_blank" href="https://thewhoweareproject.org/the-film">Who We Are</a>: A
Chronicle of Racism in America (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81488493">Netflix</a>); and Nikole
Hannah-Jones’s The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/magazine/1619-project-hulu.html">1619
Project</a>, a six part docuseries (<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-1619-project-7ba3407a-299c-4a10-8310-bbcdd6ab4653">Hulu</a>).</p>
<p>I watched Robinson’s film last night on Netflix and it is excellent.
At the beginning of the film Robinson meets a man standing in front of a
Confederate statue waving a Confederate flag. The two have a
conversation about whether that flag was a symbol of slavery and even
about the nature of slavery itself. The Neo-Confederate maintains that
slaves were just like members of slave-holders’ families and his flag
had nothing to do with slavery. But in less than a minute the Harvard
Law-trained film-maker demonstrates the contradictions of the
flag-waver’s contentions. This confrontation with willful ignorance
frames the film’s narrative.</p>
<p>Robinson, who is from Memphis and whose personal story is interwoven
into the documentary, goes on to show — using the words of politicians
of the time, state and federal laws and rulings, and historical
documents — that America most <em>definitely</em> was founded on
slavery. He quotes former president Donald Trump — yes, America’s chief
racist ignoramus and a fan of Jackson — who says that Andrew Jackson
would <em>never</em> have let the US slide into civil war, then points
out that Jackson died 16 years before that war. Robinson goes on to show
that Jackson in fact was a slave-owner himself who even posted an ad for
the return of one of his own slaves — promising to pay the finder a
little extra for giving the slave 300 lashes with a whip. This is who is
on our $20 bill.</p>
<p>We wait for Robinson to complete the sentence with “this is who we
are” but his stealth title “Who We Are” instead does that job for him.
Robinson not once mentions the usual bromide that White America uses on
the occasion of some new racial atrocity (“this is not who we are”).
Robinson just <em>knows</em>. And we all ought to know by now: this is
<em>exactly</em> who we are.</p>
<p>In perhaps the most moving segment of the film Robinson, who worked
with the ACLU for many years, returns to Memphis with his brother and
visits their boyhood home — a house that had to be purchased with a
little subterfuge by a white couple and then transferred to Robinson’s
parents. He talks about how that home made him who he is today and how
everyone on that street worked hard, did their best for their children,
and had all the same hopes his parents did. It is not a bitter
reminiscence, but Robinson points out that what white supremacy really
means is that the playing field will never be level for everyone on that
street — because of government institutions that created land-grant
colleges for whites, redlining for blacks, land dispossession for
indigenous people, and the recycling of slave-catching practices in
police institutions. Robinson methodically shows us how many of our
racialized institutions are still working as designed years after the
Civil Rights movement ended. And the damage to their victims
continues.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html">1619
Project</a> has become a lightning rod for people who can’t accept that
America was founded on slavery and continues to do everything it can to
preserve slavery’s vestiges and inequities. <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/viewers-blast-controversial-hulu-special-1619-project-fan-fiction-history">FOX
News</a> predictably wrote the series off as “fan fiction” and
“slander.” The <a
target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/06/1619-project-couldnt-get-more-cartoonish-even-as-a-disney-project/">New
York Post</a> called it “cartoonish” and a “pretense” and wrote off one
of the interviewed academics as a “Marxist.” And of course, the 1619
Project has been <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/florida-board-of-education-approves-rule-banning-1619-project-from-classrooms/">banned
in Florida</a> by racist governor Ron DeSantis and his appointees to the
state Board of Education.</p>
<p>The series consists of six episodes, the last of which will air
tomorrow: Democracy; Race; Music; Capitalism; Fear; and Justice. While
Jeffery Robinson never indicts Capitalism outright for the sins of
slavery, Hannah-Jones does so explicitly and this is the most likely
reason for her rough treatment. But let’s be honest: slavery was a
commercial enterprise. The value of slave labor made Alabama,
Mississippi, and Georgia among the richest in the nation. When slavery
ended these states instantly ended up at the bottom of the American
economic barrel because human <em>capital</em> (that is humans as
<em>property</em>) had been instantly struck from the ledgers. And it
wasn’t just Southern plantations which profited from the products of
slave labor. Massachusetts textile factories depended on cotton that had
been harvested <em>for free</em> by humans under the whip. The New York
stock exchange, companies like Lehman Brothers, and insurance industries
like AIG — as Robinson shows, too — fed off slavery and toyed with
declaring themselves neutral in order to continue to profit from human
bondage.</p>
<p>In what is most certainly one of the great ironies of history, while
the 1619 Project has been banned and its use in Florida schools now
constitutes a felony, it is now available in Germany — a country that
knows something about white supremacy and book burnings — and is now
ashamed of it.</p>
<p>The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/us-geschichte-das-projekt-1619-als-buch-18635325.html">Frankurter
Allgemeine Zeitung</a> carried a review of the 1619 Project in its book
section, pointing out that Americans are woefully (even willfully)
ignorant of their own history. Andreas Eckert cites a 2018 Southern
Poverty Law Center <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.splcenter.org/20180131/teaching-hard-history">study</a>
which shows how ignorant of American history, particularly its ugliest
aspects, American High School students are. Only 8% of American high
schoolers could identify correctly the reason the Civil War was fought:
slavery. Eckert quotes Yale history professor and Frederick Douglass
biographer David Blight, who wrote the introduction to the SPLC’s
“Teaching Hard History.” Blight observes that Americans always prefer to
view our history in the most positive light, regarding ourselves as a
beacon unto the world, bringing progress, freedom, justice, prosperity,
and happiness to the benighted. This certainly seems to constitute the
“patriotic curriculum” that <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-desantis-bill-signings-20210622-rnlsbg5lnffkfclifsjz4hyezy-story.html">Ron
DeSantis</a> is now about to jam down the throats of Florida public
school students.</p>
<p>One of the greatest controversies over the 1619 Project is whether
the American Revolution was fought (even in part) to preserve slavery.
Hannah-Jones unapologetically says it was. In the same SPLC preface to
“Teaching Hard History,” Hasan Kwame Jeffries writes, “In the Preamble
to the U.S. Constitution, the Founding Fathers enumerated the lofty
goals of their radical experiment in democracy; racial justice, however,
was not included in that list. Instead, they embedded protections for
slavery and the transatlantic slave trade into the founding document,
guaranteeing inequality for generations to come.” It doesn’t take much
to verify these facts.</p>
<p>For starters, 34 of the 47 signers — a <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/sep/10/arlen-parsa/evidence-shows-most-47-men-famous-declaration-inde/">majority</a>
— of the Declaration of Independence were slave owners. Among the most
<a
target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Founding-Fathers-and-Slavery-1269536">famous
slave owners</a>: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock,
Patrick Henry, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin Rush,
John Adams, Samuel Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and (a
distant relative on my mother’s side) Charles Carroll. So don’t even try
to convince me these morally compromised men created a nation for all
the beating hearts in it.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence has always rung hollow to Black
people. Frederick Douglass delivered a <a
target="_blank" href="https://edsitement.neh.gov/student-activities/frederick-douglasss-what-slave-fourth-july">scathing
oration</a> “What, to the Slave, is the Fourth of July?” Aside from its
authors and its hypocrisy, the Declaration calls indigenous people
“merciless Indian Savages” and whines that King George is inhibiting the
theft of indigenous land.</p>
<p>William J. Aceves, in “<a
target="_blank" href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1259&amp;context=penn_law_review_online">Amending
a Racist Constitution</a>,” shows us <em>precisely</em> where slavery
was baked into the Constitutional cake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the Constitution never uses the words “slave” or “slavery,” the
shadows of these malignant words inhabit its text. Four constitutional
provisions reflect a legal architecture that treats Black people as
property. Two of these provisions are substantive, and two are
procedural.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 is the notorious Three-Fifths Clause.
This provision is used to determine the number of congressional
representatives apportioned to a state as well as its corresponding tax
obligations. Free persons, including those bound to service for a term
of years, were included in the calculation of state populations. In
contrast, slaves would be calculated as three-fifths of a person. Native
Americans who were not taxed would not be included in these
calculations. While the Three-Fifths Clause did not directly affect the
rights of slaves, it served as clear evidence of their inequality. The
Clause also had a profound impact on the power structure in Congress by
providing slave states disproportionate political influence in the House
for decades. Because of this, the slave states were even less inclined
to end slavery.</p>
<p>Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3 represents the Fugitive Slave Clause.
It provides that any person who escapes from servitude and flees to
another state may not gain their freedom. Instead, that person must be
returned to the custody of their owner. This clause was used on
countless occasions to perpetuate slavery. Individuals who had escaped
from bondage by crossing state lines were subject to capture and
returned to slavery. Those who aided such efforts were subject to civil
or even criminal liability. While there was some resistance to its
application, this pernicious clause made anti-slavery states and the
federal government complicit in slavery. This complicity even extended
to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 9, Clause 1 limited the ability of Congress to
adopt legislation prohibiting the migration or importation of slaves
until 1808. Congress drafted around this restriction in 1803, when it
adopted An Act to Prevent the Importation of Certain Persons into
Certain States, Where, by the Laws Thereof, Their Admission is
Prohibited. This statute was adopted at the request of the slave states,
which were concerned with the rise of free people of color in the United
States and viewed the successful slave rebellion in Haiti with
trepidation. Four years later, Congress took a more significant step
with the Act to Prohibit the Importation of Slaves Into Any Port or
Place Within the Jurisdiction of the United States. While the statute
was drafted to end the slave trade in the United States, the practice of
slavery remained legal.</p>
<p>Finally, Article V addresses the process for constitutional
amendments. These amendments can be proposed for state ratification by a
two-thirds vote in both Houses. Alternatively, amendments can be
proposed through a constitutional convention called by a two-thirds vote
of the states. Either process then requires approval by three-fourths of
the states. Reflecting one of the central compromises to the
Constitution, Article V prohibited any amendment to Article I, Section
9, Clause 1 until 1808. Working in tandem, these provisions ensured that
the slave trade would remain legal in the United States for at least
twenty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Robinson’s film, Black students sing the third stanza of the
American National Anthem (“the Star-Spangled Banner”) by Francis Scott
Key, a Maryland slave owner. This stanza sings of the depravity and
deserved slaughter of slaves who try to escape:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No refuge could save the hireling and slave</em> <em>From the
terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,</em> <em>And the
star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave</em> <em>O’er the land of the
free and the home of the brave.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the last stanza implies that the republic is meant only for
non-slaves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand</em> <em>Between their
lov’d home and the war’s desolation!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>American Conservatives may be incensed at scholarship that at long
last proves our nation was founded on and built by slavery, but there is
no getting around the fact: it was. The <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-09-02/read-joe-bidens-address-on-the-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-nation">battle
for the nation’s soul</a> may be on some people’s lips but it means
little without recognition, repair, repentance, restitution — and major
revision of our laws. But we can’t even begin if we can’t agree on facts
of history that can be easily and objectively verified.</p>
<p>In our hearts of hearts we know the contents of our nation’s soul and
who we are as a people. And, if we’re honest, it isn’t very pretty.</p>
<p>This is who we are.</p>
