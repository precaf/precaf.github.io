Across the country — and unfortunately, here in Massachusetts — we  are seeing [right-wing](https://massinformedparents.substack.com/p/only-4-more-weeks-to-submit-your) advocates mobilizing on behalf of narrowing school curricula, banning books, and erasing the experiences of LGBTQ youth.

That’s why we were pleased when Governor Healey took a step to move Massachusetts in the opposite direction – that of inclusion.

According to [Sex Ed for Social Change](https://siecus.org/), which follows state trends in sex education, the curriculum framework for schools here in [Massachusetts](https://siecus.org/state_profile/massachusetts-state-profile-23/) was last updated in 1999.

Healey’s proposed [updated curriculum](https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/06/27/maura-healey-massachusetts-sexual-education-curriculum-update-newsletter) framework reflects the Healthy Youth Act (MA bills [S.268](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S268/Cosponsor) and [H.544](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H544/Cosponsor)) by requiring that sex education be comprehensive, medically accurate, age-appropriate, consent-based, and inclusive — as it should be, and as it should have been a generation ago.

This legislation offers parents the ability to opt their children out of classes, and local schools the flexibility to shape their own curriculum. It is [endorsed](https://support.fenwayhealth.org/page/48547/action/1) by the MA [Healthy Youth Coalition](https://www.healthyyouthact.org/) (HYC) and has broad legislative support.
