Dear Ms. McKinnon:

I am writing today in full support of the new comprehensive health and physical education curriculum framework. An updated framework grounded in science that reflects best practices helps health educators teach students what they need to know at every grade level. 

Massachusetts is one of 21 states that does not yet require sex education and existing standards covering STDs and health relationships still need work. Governor Healy's proposals which have been realized in the DESE draft and supported by new state legislation recognize and address these deficits. They also address concerns of parents whose religious beliefs do not accept non-normative aspects of sexuality and gender since the legislation provides for opting-out.

But for an overwhelming number of Commonwealth families it is important that students have a health curriculum which emphasizes the importance of consent in a healthy relationship and one that is inclusive of students of all gender identities and sexual orientations. 

I urge DESE to vote to adopt this new Framework and I look forward to learning how DESE will support educators in implementing it in their classrooms. 

Sincerely,

Name & address
