##### Sample text

Dear Committee Chairs and SouthCoast legislators,

I am writing in support of An Act to protect patient privacy and prevent unfair and deceptive advertising of pregnancy-related services by so called "pregnancy crisis centers" (Senate Bill S.174 and House Bill H.377). These fake clinics deceptively and fraudulently advertise medical services to women seeking abortions but offer none, use strong-arm tactics including releasing personal information to third parties, and engage women in counseling and religious proselytizing well into late stage pregnancy in order to ultimately prevent the abortion. Massachusetts bills S.174 and H.377 thankfully put legal protections in place to protect women and prevent such centers from masquerading as health care clinics.

Sincerely,

name
